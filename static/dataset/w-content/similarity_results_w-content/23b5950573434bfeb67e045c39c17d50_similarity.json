Did you know that there are over 100 deaths per year from golf-related accidents? Yes, that's right. Those deaths are the result of golfers falling off of golf carts, being hit by golf balls and even dying from heart attacks. Some golfers also get arthritis because of the repetitive swinging of the golf club. And then let's consider cross country. I've heard of runners getting heat stroke and even dying from it. And as a former runner, I can tell you that running is not a safe sport. Many of my teammates suffered from shin splints, stress fractures and even plantar fasciitis. And plenty of my teammates also had to deal with knee and ankle injuries. On top of that, cross country is a sport where you can get hit by a car. Many of my teammates also had psychological issues involved with the sport too, because of the pressure to perform well and to break school records.\n",

Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the amount of danger involved in a sport should have no bearing on whether that activity constitutes a sport or not. A sport is defined to be a physical activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often engaged in competitively. Nowhere in the definition of a sport does it say that the activity must be safe. And in fact, think about some of the most popular sports in America. Football, hockey, boxing and mixed martial arts are all extremely dangerous sports. I recently read that football players are three times more likely to die from a brain injury than the average person. And don't even get me started on the dangers involved in boxing and mixed martial arts. Did you know that in the past decade, there have been over 1,000 deaths in boxing? And further, that there have been over 1,000 deaths in mixed martial arts since the sport's inception in 1993? If we have those kinds of statistics for sports that are considered to be \"safe,\" what does that say about the dangers involved in other sports?\n\nI just don't think that there is any way to make a sport that is inherently competitive and inherently involves a test of physical and mental strength totally safe from all risks. After all, think about some of the sports that you'd likely to be consider more mundane and safe. Let's take golf, for example. Did you know that there are over 100 deaths per year from golf-related accidents? Yes, that's right. Those deaths are the result of golfers falling off of golf carts, being hit by golf balls and even dying from heart attacks. Some golfers also get arthritis because of the repetitive swinging of the golf club. And then let's consider cross country. I've heard of runners getting heat stroke and even dying from it. And as a former runner, I can tell you that running is not a safe sport. Many of my teammates suffered from shin splints, stress fractures and even plantar fasciitis. And plenty of my teammates also had to deal with knee and ankle injuries. On top of that, cross country is a sport where you can get hit by a car. Many of my teammates also had psychological issues involved with the sport too, because of the pressure to perform well and to break school records. As a result, many of the athletes developed eating disorders and even had to seek psychological counseling.\n\nSo is extreme mountain climbing really that much more dangerous than the sports that we all know and love to be safe sports? I don't really think so. While it's true that extreme mountain climbing is dangerous, it's also true that there are plenty of other sports that are just as dangerous. On the surface, it might seem that extreme mountain climbing is more dangerous than other sports, but when you really look at the statistics, it's not that much different. And extreme mountain climbing deaths and injuries might be more publicized because of the nature of the sport, but that doesn't mean that it's any more dangerous than other sports. When was the last time you heard about a golfer dying from a heart attack or a runner dying from heat stroke? It's likely that those stories haven't made the headlines but that doesn't necessarily indicate that those sports are any safer than extreme mountain climbing.\n\nSo in conclusion, I think that it's silly to say that extreme mountain climbing is a dangerous sport. All sports are dangerous so it's sort of just a redundancy to have to expressly state that. And I think that it's also silly to say that extreme mountain climbing is not a sport.\n",

        "sentence": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the amount of danger involved in a sport should have no bearing on whether that activity constitutes a sport or not. A sport is defined to be a physical activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often engaged in competitively. Nowhere in the definition of a sport does it say that the activity must be safe. And in fact, think about some of the most popular sports in America. Football, hockey, boxing and mixed martial arts are all extremely dangerous sports. I recently read that football players are three times more likely to die from a brain injury than the average person. And don't even get me started on the dangers involved in boxing and mixed martial arts. Did you know that in the past decade, there have been over 1,000 deaths in boxing? And further, that there have been over 1,000 deaths in mixed martial arts since the sport's inception in 1993? If we have those kinds of statistics for sports that are considered to be \"safe,\" what does that say about the dangers involved in other sports?\n\nI just don't think that there is any way to make a sport that is inherently competitive and inherently involves a test of physical and mental strength totally safe from all risks. After all, think about some of the sports that you'd likely to be consider more mundane and safe. Let's take golf, for example. Did you know that there are over 100 deaths per year from golf-related accidents? Yes, that's right. Those deaths are the result of golfers falling off of golf carts, being hit by golf balls and even dying from heart attacks. Some golfers also get arthritis because of the repetitive swinging of the golf club. And then let's consider cross country. I've heard of runners getting heat stroke and even dying from it. And as a former runner, I can tell you that running is not a safe sport. Many of my teammates suffered from shin splints, stress fractures and even plantar fasciitis. And plenty of my teammates also had to deal with knee and ankle injuries. On top of that, cross country is a sport where you can get hit by a car. Many of my teammates also had psychological issues involved with the sport too, because of the pressure to perform well and to break school records. As a result, many of the athletes developed eating disorders and even had to seek psychological counseling.\n\nSo is extreme mountain climbing really that much more dangerous than the sports that we all know and love to be safe sports? I don't really think so. While it's true that extreme mountain climbing is dangerous, it's also true that there are plenty of other sports that are just as dangerous. On the surface, it might seem that extreme mountain climbing is more dangerous than other sports, but when you really look at the statistics, it's not that much different. And extreme mountain climbing deaths and injuries might be more publicized because of the nature of the sport, but that doesn't mean that it's any more dangerous than other sports. When was the last time you heard about a golfer dying from a heart attack or a runner dying from heat stroke? It's likely that those stories haven't made the headlines but that doesn't necessarily indicate that those sports are any safer than extreme mountain climbing.\n\nSo in conclusion, I think that it's silly to say that extreme mountain climbing is a dangerous sport. All sports are dangerous so it's sort of just a redundancy to have to expressly state that. And I think that it's also silly to say that extreme mountain climbing is not a sport. Does it involve physical activity? Does it involve a set of rules? Does it involve competition? I can check \n",

And extreme mountain climbing deaths and injuries might be more publicized because of the nature of the sport, but that doesn't mean that it's any more dangerous than other sports. When was the last time you heard about a golfer dying from a heart attack or a runner dying from heat stroke? It's likely that those stories haven't made the headlines but that doesn't necessarily indicate that those sports are any safer than extreme mountain climbing.\n\nSo in conclusion, I think that it's silly to say that extreme mountain climbing is a dangerous sport. All sports are dangerous so it's sort of just a redundancy to have to expressly state that. And I think that it's also silly to say that extreme mountain climbing is not a sport. Does it involve physical activity? Does it involve a set of rules? Does it involve competition? I can check all of those boxes. So it certainly meets the criteria for a sport. I think we can all set aside the level of safety for the sake of argument here, because it's not really that relevant to the question of whether or not extreme mountain climbing is a sport.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm someone who enjoys a good debate.

Football, hockey, boxing and mixed martial arts are all extremely dangerous sports. I recently read that football players are three times more likely to die from a brain injury than the average person. And don't even get me started on the dangers involved in boxing and mixed martial arts. Did you know that in the past decade, there have been over 1,000 deaths in boxing? And further, that there have been over 1,000 deaths in mixed martial arts since the sport's inception in 1993?

After all, think about some of the sports that you'd likely to be consider more mundane and safe. Let's take golf, for example. Did you know that there are over 100 deaths per year from golf-related accidents? Yes, that's right. Those deaths are the result of golfers falling off of golf carts, being hit by golf balls and even dying from heart attacks. Some golfers also get arthritis because of the repetitive swinging of the golf club. And then let's consider cross country. I've heard of runners getting heat stroke and even dying from it. And as a former runner, I can tell you that running is not a safe sport. Many of my teammates suffered from shin splints, stress fractures and even plantar fasciitis. And plenty of my teammates also had to deal with knee and ankle injuries. On top of that, cross country is a sport where you can get hit by a car. Many of my teammates also had psychological issues involved with the sport too, because of the pressure to perform well and to break school records. As a result, many of the athletes developed eating disorders and even had to seek psychological counseling.\n\nSo is extreme mountain climbing really that much more dangerous than the sports that we all know and love to be safe sports?

        "sentence": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the amount of danger involved in a sport should have no bearing on whether that activity constitutes a sport or not. A sport is defined to be a physical activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often engaged in competitively. Nowhere in the definition of a sport does it say that the activity must be safe. And in fact, think about some of the most popular sports in America. Football, hockey, boxing and mixed martial arts are all extremely dangerous sports. I recently read that football players are three times more likely to die from a brain injury than the average person. And don't even get me started on the dangers involved in boxing and mixed martial arts. Did you know that in the past decade, there have been over 1,000 deaths in boxing? And further, that there have been over 1,000 deaths in mixed martial arts since the sport's inception in 1993? If we have those kinds of statistics for sports that are considered to be \"safe,\" what does that say about the dangers involved in other sports?\n\nI just don't think that there is any way to make a sport that is inherently competitive and inherently involves a test of physical and mental strength totally safe from all risks. After all, think about some of the sports that you'd likely to be consider more mundane and safe. Let's take golf, for example. Did you know that there are over 100 deaths per year from golf-related accidents? Yes, that's right. Those deaths are the result of golfers falling off of golf carts, being hit by golf balls and even dying from heart attacks. Some golfers also get arthritis because of the repetitive swinging of the golf club. And then let's consider cross country. I've heard of runners getting heat stroke and even dying from it. And as a former runner, I can tell you that running is not a safe sport. Many of my teammates suffered from shin splints, stress fractures and even plantar fasciitis. And plenty of my teammates also had to deal with knee and ankle injuries. On top of that, cross country is a sport where you can get hit by a car. Many of my teammates also had psychological issues involved with the sport too, because of the pressure to perform well and to break school records. As a result, many of the athletes developed eating disorders and even had to seek psychological counseling.\n\nSo is extreme mountain climbing really that much more dangerous than the sports that we all know and love to be safe sports? I don't really think so. While it's true that extreme mountain climbing is dangerous, it's also true that there are plenty of other sports that are just as dangerous. On the surface, it might seem that extreme mountain climbing is more dangerous than other sports, but when you really look at the statistics, it's not that much different. And extreme mountain climbing deaths and injuries might be more publicized because of the nature of the sport, but that doesn't mean that it's any more dangerous than other sports. When was the last time you heard about a golfer dying from a heart attack or a runner dying from heat stroke? It's likely that those stories haven't made the headlines but that doesn't necessarily indicate that those sports are any safer than extreme mountain climbing.\n\nSo in conclusion, I think that it's silly to say that extreme mountain climbing is a dangerous sport. All sports are dangerous so it's sort of just a redundancy to have to expressly state that. And I think that it's also silly to say that extreme mountain climbing is not a sport. Does it involve physical activity? Does it involve a set of rules? Does it involve competition? I can check all of those boxes. So it certainly meets the criteria for a sport. I think we can all set aside the level of safety for the sake of argument here, because it's not really that relevant to the question of whether or not extreme mountain climbing is a sport.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm someone who enjoys a good debate. So I'm willing to listen to your arguments and to consider your point of view. But that doesn't mean that I'm going to change my mind. I'm very certain that extreme mountain climbing is a sport and I'm also very certain that it's not any more dangerous than other sports. But I welcome you to share your thoughts on the matter.\n",
