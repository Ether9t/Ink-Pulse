        "sentence": "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nYou start to feel strange prickles on your skin. You look at your arms and see tiny bee hairs coming out of your skin in the colors of black and yellow. You start to panic and scream. You feel pain on the tips of your shoulder blades. Two giant wings burst out of your back and you scream even louder. The wings are dark brown with yellow stripes. You can't control them and you flail about.\n\n\"Slowly, your majesty!\" the bee on your shoulder chirps. \"You mustn't strain your new wings!\"\n\n\"I can't control them!\" you yell.\n\nYou flail about some more and feel a sharp pain in your back. You turn around and see a pair of stingers, like those of a bee, sticking out your back. You feel a tickle on your face and start flailing again. Two antennae burst from your forehead. \n\nYou see your hands, which have gained a kind of bee-pollen fuzz. You look at your chest and you start to see a faint black-and-yellow striped pattern. You look down at your feet and see that they've turned into bee's feet, complete with the two little hooks for climbing.\n\n\"What in God's name?! What the hell?!\" You shout hysterically. \n\n\"SHUT UP AND LISTEN, YOUR MAJESTY!\" The tiny bee shouts. \"You are now a queen! You have always been a part bee, and now that you've hit adulthood, you are taking your final form.\" \n\n\"I'm a bee?!\" you yell. \n\n\"A bee-human hybrid, yes.\" The bee says calmly. \"You are queen of the bees, and you will live out your days here in this hive.\" She points to a giant castle made of honeycomb in the distance. \"You will live here with your subjects, and you will never be alone.\"\n\nThis is agony.

You feel a sharp pain in your forearm. \n\nJust then, your world shatters and you come to, you're in an aid unit. A doctor yells into your face, \"Stay with me, ma'am! You've taken an extreme dose of MDMA and we are going to get you back to normal soon!\"\n\nYou are so relieved. You aren't a bee. You're just a druggy instead. The hospital treats you and sends you home so that you can continue to do drugs until the day you die.\n\nThe end.\n",
