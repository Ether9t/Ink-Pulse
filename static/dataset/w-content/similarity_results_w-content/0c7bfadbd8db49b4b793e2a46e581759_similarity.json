The Lost decided they must do something they never thought they would. They must give their proven, more effective miracle medicine to all of the Lucky ones.  So they did. Again, the results were instantaneous. The suffering would end. But not as the Lost imagined it would, with a cure for the Lucky and renewed immortality. But with a pop and bang and puff of smoke as the Lucky simply vanished off the face of the Earth. \n\nAfter the death of the Lucky, the remaining Lost colonies began to form their own governments and figure out what to do next. It was decided that they must not allow the same mistakes of their previous society to be repeated. So they pulled the best, brightest and most intelligent minds from each of the remaining colonies. These people began to work on a new and improved drug for immortality in the event the same situation were to strike them that had been inflicted upon the Lucky. \n\nAnd again, their efforts were successful. But the strain of creating this drug took its toll on the minds and bodies of these remaining individuals, so they built a home for themselves in space where they could work in peace and quiet on their next miracle drug.\n",
