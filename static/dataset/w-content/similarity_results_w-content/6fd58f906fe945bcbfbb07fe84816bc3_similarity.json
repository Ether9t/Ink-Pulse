There are many sports that are dangerous but they are still considered a sport. Even a child playing football could end up with a head injury and many parents consider that an acceptable risk. I feel that as long as a sport is popular then public opinion tends to be that the risk is worth it. \n\nIt shouldn't be considered selfish to do extreme sports. What we really should focus on is just ensuring that these sports are as safe as possible because people aren't going to stop doing them. That's honestly the best approach to the situation. Then if they are safer maybe we won't judge the people participating in them quite as much. \n\n",
