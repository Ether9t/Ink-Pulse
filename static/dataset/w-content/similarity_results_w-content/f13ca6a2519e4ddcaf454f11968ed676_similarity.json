They will begin to search the ship for supplies and technology, as well as attempt to try and salvage the engine. \n\nThey have radio contact with the president who suggests that they begin to build the new civilization on board. They are told that they can build anything they want and that this is their new home. These five hundred survivors are the chosen ones, and they must begin to settle and start a new life on this spaceship. These five hundred people call themselves the Arkians, and they certainly feel a great sense of honor to be able to embark on this task. Bit by bit, they salvage enough technology to be able to build the new order Ark right there on the spaceship. Society among the Ark flourishes under the leadership of the original 500 people, and they call themselves the Kingdom of 500. This Kingdom does much to advance the agenda of the United States back on planet Earth, and the president of the United States is lauded for his foresight in launching the Ark. \n",
