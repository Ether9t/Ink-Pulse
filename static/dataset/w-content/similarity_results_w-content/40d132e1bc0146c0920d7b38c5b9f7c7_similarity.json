She can't not like herself. \n\nHe was right. When she saw herself she was beyond intrigued. She apparently had an interest in doppelgangers that he was not aware of. She was so into herself that she couldn't resist. She just wanted to spend time with her doppelganger. He knew enough about her to be able to pretend to be her flawlessly. \n\nNothing romantic came of it. He was just happy to be with her. It was a way to do that even if it wasn't at all what he had hoped for. He would shape shift into her and basically just hang out around her apartment while pretending to be her. It was quite the unusual love story. \n\nEventually she asked him to move in with her. He of course agreed. Now he was living with her, and they were spending all of their time together. He no longer had an identity of his own, even if they were just ones he had created while shape shifting. Now he was her all of the time. He was her boyfriend.\n",

        "sentence": "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. He has a huge chart at home to keep track of it. It shows all of the likes and dislikes that he has learned of hers over time. He's hoping that if he can just get the right combination, she'll love him back. \n\nHe made himself into the perfect looking man. He had muscles and chiseled features and really should be hard to resist. But she just wasn't interested. He realized that yet again as he tried to move forward with their relationship. He just couldn't get her to love him. He decided to try something drastic that was a hail Mary move basically. He shape shifted to look exactly like her. People like themselves, right? She can't not like herself. \n\nHe was right. When she saw herself she was beyond intrigued. She apparently had an interest in doppelgangers that he was not aware of.

In reality he was just a fascination for her. You can't always pick how you will be loved but you must accept it. \n",
