What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the most important thing students should learn in school is music. Music is a great way to express yourself and it can be very fun. It builds strong team skills, and is also great at teaching one how to work well alone. It is also a great way to express your feelings, and can help you get through tough times. If music is introduced early on in school, it can help students to be more open and creative. Each student should be matched to their ideal instrument. This will help them to be more successful in the future. There should be time set aside for music every day, and it should be mandatory. Studies have shown that music helps to improve memory, and can help students to be more successful in school. It helps improve focus and attention span. It also helps to improve self-esteem and confidence. Students that don't study music in school are at a disadvantage. They are more likely to have lower grades, and are more likely to drop out of school.\n",
