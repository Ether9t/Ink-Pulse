Now all they had to do was get the parts to upgrade their current system . They had to go to China to get the parts, but they had to get permission from the UN to do so.   The US went to the UN and asked for permission to go to China to get the parts to upgrade their current system. The UN denied their request.   The US was furious. They were not going to let the UN stop them from getting to the moon. They were going to get those parts no matter what.   They went to China and got the parts. They were able to upgrade their system and get to the moon in less than 12 hours.   The US was now on the moon and they were looking for clues of what China had done to get ahead of them.\n",

The US went in thinking it will come out 50 years later still being the top country in the world, but found out that the rest of the world passed them by and everything was just so different from before. They kept pondering and thinking and trying to come up with ideas of how they are gonna catch up the rest of the universe .  China was on top at this time and were light years ahead of anything the US had thought of. They had the best technology and the best of everything.   The US was in a state of shock and disbelief. They had no idea what to do. The US was in a state of panic. They had to do something, but what?   They decided to go to the moon to see if they could find any clues of what China had done to get ahead of them. They still had the technology to get to the moon but China had the best tech at the time that would get their people to the moon in less than 12 hours. So the US had to go back to the drawing board and come up with something that would get them there fast.   They came up with a rocket that would get them to the moon in less than 12 hours.

As china is such a secretive nation they decided to go back to their country and just give in and realized that China has won and there is no way they could make up 50 years of losing out on almost everything. They accepted now being the 50 least technologically advanced nation in the world . \n",
