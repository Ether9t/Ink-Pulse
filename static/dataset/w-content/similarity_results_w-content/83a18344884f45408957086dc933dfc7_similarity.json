Reproductive health should be treated the same as any other public-health issue.  If toilet paper is necessary for every student and public-health issue, then so are pads and tampons.  \n\nIf you have some objection to the cost of these supplies, just ask yourself if you would be willing to give up free toilet paper, soap, and Band-Aids in public.  If it's not acceptable when it happens to you, then it's not acceptable when it happens to anyone.\n\nAnd that is, literally, all there is to say.\n",
