        "sentence": "You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\n\"I've prepared my whole life for this,\" said Barack as he packed his bags full of his items. He was careful not to be seen by Michelle, his wife and his kids. His guard, Reggie, was nearby to ensure that he wouldn't be discovered. Nodding to Reggie as he exited his house, Barack said, \"I'll see you in a couple days.\"\n\nHours later, Barack arrived at the secret JFK compound. \"You're here. Good...there's a lot to get done before we can go into the field,\" said JFK as he pointed to an array of weapons on the table.\" JFK said. They immediately went to the conference hall with all of the other United States presidents alive and well, waiting for JFK to address them. \"I'm sure you've heard by now, but the world has been in a state of peril as of late.\"\n\n\"But I thought we had ended all wars in the Middle East,\" said Bill Clinton. \"It's not a war in the Middle East, Bill. It's not a war with any other country on earth. It is a war against the human race.\" \n\nBill Clinton and the other presidents stood quietly. They know what JFK is talking about. \"We, the lizardmen are here to wipe out the human race.\" Said JFK as he and the other presidents slowly revealed their true form. They were flaky and slimy kind of like reptilians. They blink sideways and lick their mouths in a reptilian manner.\n\n\"The humans did not know that the planet is already crawling with lizardmen.\" said President Theodore Roosevelt. \"they did not know that the elections were rigged, right from the start,\" he continued.\n\nLittle did they know Barack Obama was a decoy. Barack knew all along that the presidents were all lizardmen. He revealed his gun on his backpack and started shooting all the previous presidents who were now lizardmen.\n\nHe killed them all. \"I hate lizardmen.\" He said as he wear his sunglasses and lit the building on fire without looking back.\n",
