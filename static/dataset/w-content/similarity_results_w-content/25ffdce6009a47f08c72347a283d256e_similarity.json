Everything costs money these days, and honestly, some students simply don't have anything extra in their families. It really isn't about handing these out in bulk, but having the school provide them for emergencies or when a student begins her period on a day she didn't expect to. It is inconvenient to have to search out an adult to get a feminine product, and awkward when all you can find are male teachers. Most of the athletic coaches are my girls' schools are men, and both of my daughters have called me to bring them pads because they were too embarrassed to ask the coach for one. There should be no reason that this is happening.\n\nThe only way these items are different is that the male students don't need them. Not sure if that is the reason they still aren't readily available or not. It does make me wonder if the boys needed these items, would they be in abundance? I absolutely think these items should be required by school. Giving the girls tokens of some sort if the school wanted to keep a machine in the girls bathrooms and locker rooms would be an idea. Each girl could get a certain number of tokens every month to access the machines and get what she needed. I have been to schools where there were pad and tampon machines in the girl's areas, but they cost a quarter to purchase. Honestly, what student is really carrying around change to buy these?\n\nThis is a basic need that females have to deal with every month. It already sucks enough without having to go and beg for a pad or tampon when you are having a crisis and bleeding in your underwear. There is no valid reason in my mind for the schools not to provide these items.\n",
