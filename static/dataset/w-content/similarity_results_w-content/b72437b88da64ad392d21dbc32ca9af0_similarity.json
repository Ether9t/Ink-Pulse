She tells him that she found out about the date, though she won't disclose how she did it, and arranged a problem with his new girlfriend's car to delay her, so that she could convince him to break off the new relationship and be with her instead. Then, she leaves to go powder her nose.\n\nInstead of her coming back, the new girlfriend arrives at the table.  She tells him that he has to choose between her, and the other woman, and he needs to do it now.  He can't decide, and she also leaves, and the other girl comes back. He has a moment of insight; this woman is also a shapeshifter, and she's been toying with him. 'What's the game, why are you doing this?' he asks.  She replies 'I have a thing about guys who can't make decisions easily, I can't stand them. It was a test, and you failed.' She changes shape one final time, then leaves the restaurant, and he never sees her again, in either of these forms, or any other.\n",
