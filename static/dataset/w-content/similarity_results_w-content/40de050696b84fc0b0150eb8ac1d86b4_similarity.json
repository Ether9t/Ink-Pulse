There are plenty of content available for people to watch, read, or hear, that can be entertaining and informative. Many of these shows are not offensive in its depiction of its characters, and don't necessarly rely on stereotypes. I think many shows, books, and other forms of content will continue to improve in how it depicts its characters, with more content like it becoming more numerous and widespread. Thus I think it is important for myself and others to support such content, and to not watch or even critique content that portray people as negative stereotypes.\n",
