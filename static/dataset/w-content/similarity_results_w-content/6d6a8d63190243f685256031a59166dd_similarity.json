        "sentence": "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing.\n\nI am part of a rapid response team that is tasked with protecting and retrieving Matt Damon from alien kidnappers.   Our leader is John Krasinski, who calls himself “Big Daddy”.   I think he is the only person who calls himself that.  Matt was kidnapped two hours ago from his home in Boston, Massachusetts.   When the aliens broke into his home, Matt attempted to fight back.  He was able to injure one of the aliens.\n\n \nThe alien was able to escape, but left behind a small chip.  Using this chip, it should be easy to find the aliens.  For some reason, aliens are enamored with Matt Damon.  There are at least alien two kidnapping attempts each year of Matt Damon.  That is why this task force was created.  When I scanned the chip, I was able to find the GPS coordinates of the place where I think the aliens were hiding.  Aliens are not able to quickly get off of earth to the space ship.  It takes days of preparation.  We figured they would be at their hide out.   \n\nI flew our helicopter to the coordinates, with four team members to an apartment building in New York City.  Big Daddy, sorry, John Krasinksi couldn't make it due to being on a film set.   The apartment building was huge.   However, our technology allowed us to follow the aliens trail to the penthouse suite.   We decided to enter the penthouse through the fire escape beside the penthouse.  When I peered into the window, I could see the outlines Matt Damon and the alien suspects.\n\n\nI signaled to my team.  One of the team members used a tool to cut out a large portion of the window.   The team member careful placed the  glass on the ground.  We all proceeded to move in.  I yelled out, \"Earth police!  Give up Matt Damon and get on the floor!\".   The scene inside was startling.  Matt Damon and the aliens were...watching \"Good Will Hunting\".   I turned on the lights, and shouted my order again.  Meekly, the aliens got on the floor.  I asked Matt Damon if he was OK. Matt Damon replied coolly, \"Sure.  I am used to this.\"        The aliens were calm.  I escorted Matt to the helicopter while my team members arrested the aliens.\n\nAnother successful job by the Matt Damon protection squad.\n",
