But the one thing they cannot survive, not even a little bit, is Mana.\n\nA woman named Mana Tatsumiya is the first person to be discovered to have regained her powers. Her parents named her Mana because they believe she has the power to save the world. They believe she will be the one to use Mana for the good of humankind. And apparently her parents were right about that, because Mana is the one who ends up defeating the aliens. When Mana is sixteen years old, she gets a job as a waitress at a restaurant called the Little Shrimp. The Little Shrimp is a popular restaurant, and it is owned by a man named Kyoji. Kyoji is a very kind and generous man, and he is also a very good friend of Mana's parents. One day, the aliens attack the Little Shrimp. They take Kyoji hostage, and they also hold all of Kyoji's inventory hostage. This means that customers cannot get any food or drinks from the Little Shrimp. Really, it's a sad story for all involved, especially because the Little Shrimp serves such delicious food, which includes the best shrimp in the world.\n\nBut Mana is determined to save the Little Shrimp and is even more determined to save Kyoji. She discovers that she has Mana, because while looking for Kyoji she realizes that her body is glowing. She is glowing because she has Mana. And with her Mana, she discovers that she can use it to create a sword. She uses her sword to defeat the aliens, and she also uses it to free Kyoji.\n\nKyoji is incredibly grateful to Mana. He is so grateful, in fact, that he offers to let her work at the Little Shrimp and get free meals whenever she wants them. Mana is very happy to accept this offer, because she loves the Little Shrimp's food. But she also loves the Little Shrimp's atmosphere. The Little Shrimp is a very happy place, and it's a place where everyone is welcome. It's a place where people can go to have fun, and it's a place where people can go to relax.\n",

Her parents named her Mana because they believe she has the power to save the world. They believe she will be the one to use Mana for the good of humankind. And apparently her parents were right about that, because Mana is the one who ends up defeating the aliens. When Mana is sixteen years old, she gets a job as a waitress at a restaurant called the Little Shrimp. The Little Shrimp is a popular restaurant, and it is owned by a man named Kyoji. Kyoji is a very kind and generous man, and he is also a very good friend of Mana's parents. One day, the aliens attack the Little Shrimp. They take Kyoji hostage, and they also hold all of Kyoji's inventory hostage. This means that customers cannot get any food or drinks from the Little Shrimp. Really, it's a sad story for all involved, especially because the Little Shrimp serves such delicious food, which includes the best shrimp in the world.\n\nBut Mana is determined to save the Little Shrimp and is even more determined to save Kyoji. She discovers that she has Mana, because while looking for Kyoji she realizes that her body is glowing. She is glowing because she has Mana. And with her Mana, she discovers that she can use it to create a sword. She uses her sword to defeat the aliens, and she also uses it to free Kyoji.\n\nKyoji is incredibly grateful to Mana. He is so grateful, in fact, that he offers to let her work at the Little Shrimp and get free meals whenever she wants them. Mana is very happy to accept this offer, because she loves the Little Shrimp's food. But she also loves the Little Shrimp's atmosphere. The Little Shrimp is a very happy place, and it's a place where everyone is welcome. It's a place where people can go to have fun, and it's a place where people can go to relax. Mana is very happy to work at the Little Shrimp, and she is also very happy to be a part of the Little Shrimp's family. \n\nSo that's the story of how Mana ended up defeating the aliens. And in the process of doing so, she also ended up saving the Little Shrimp. Of course, this meant she also saved humankind from the aliens, because once the aliens who had kidnapped Kyoji were destroyed, word spread quickly among the other aliens of the threat humans posed. And from then on, the aliens were very wary of humans. They did not want to be destroyed in a similar manner because they knew that humans had Mana.\n\nSo that's the story of Mana Tatsumiya. She became a hero, and she saved the world. It's kind of interesting how such a young girl was able to accomplish all that, and from such humble means too. Who would have thought that a young girl who was once a waitress at the Little Shrimp would go on to save the world?\n",
