For example, I know I loved heading to the local pizza joint and talking and dancing with girls to records and jukeboxes. And I really loved taking the girls to baseball games (and it didn't hurt, in retrospect, that I was a really good third baseman back in my high school years). It was also always fun to cut through Central Park just before sundown, or to head into the Village. Those were some wonderful times, and every date felt like a new adventure, and I still think fondly about them even today.\n\nI met my wife as a result of slipping on a patch of ice as I went out for a late-night slice of pizza at the local pizzeria. It was totally accidental, of course — I had just come from a local bar and had been carrying a drink in one hand and looking at my watch in the other.  In my defense, it was a really cold winter night. I fell and landed on my left side and was starting to get up when I saw a beautiful, tall blonde come rushing forward to help me. And I don't know if it was the cold, the drink, or the shock but I suddenly blurted out something like: \"You will make some guy very happy someday.\" And then I promptly fell back down, hit my head on the icy sidewalk, and blacked out. \n\nWhen I came to she was standing there, with a thoughtful expression on her face. As I sat up and rubbed the back of my head, I looked at her and then looked down at the pizza slice lying next to me. And she, without missing a beat, picked up the slice and handed it to me. It was then that I knew that this woman would be somebody that I would have to meet again, just so I could take her out to dinner. I took her out for pizza next week and we hit it off immediately. That was 44 years ago, and I still think fondly about that night.\n\nBut these days, most young people don't even bother to meet their potential date, just as long as he or she looks good in a profile picture. It's like they're shopping for a new car on the Internet, only the price is something called \"the compatibility rating.\" It's an impersonal and dehumanizing experience, and I don't think it does anybody any favors. After all, haven't you seen the statistics on divorce in this country? It just shouldn't surprise anyone that over half of all first marriages end in divorce, when young people don't even bother to spend time getting to know one another. Poking and swiping through selfies might work for some people, but what happens when you get off of your phone and get into the real world? Marriage isn't about finding a picture on your screen — it's about finding a person you can trust and love and spend the rest of your life with.\n\nLet's just be real, I never would have met my wife if I had been glued to my phone all the time. I was out enjoying my life in the real world, about to eat a slice of delicious New York pizza, and I hit my head on a patch of ice. And that was all it took for me to dive right into a wonderful, loving relationship.\n",

        "sentence": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, technology makes for an extremely impersonal way of dating. What happened to the good old days when young people went out on a date and actually talked with each other? Now the dating process is reduced to texting and using social media. I remember that when I was young, young people had to meet each other, talk to each other and find something in common before they could know whether they were compatible. And that led to a lot of fun nights out and a lot of wonderful, unexpected experiences. For example, I know I loved heading to the local pizza joint and talking and dancing with girls to records and jukeboxes. And I really loved taking the girls to baseball games (and it didn't hurt, in retrospect, that I was a really good third baseman back in my high school years). It was also always fun to cut through Central Park just before sundown, or to head into the Village. Those were some wonderful times, and every date felt like a new adventure, and I still think fondly about them even today.\n\nI met my wife as a result of slipping on a patch of ice as I went out for a late-night slice of pizza at the local pizzeria. It was totally accidental, of course — I had just come from a local bar and had been carrying a drink in one hand and looking at my watch in the other.  In my defense, it was a really cold winter night. I fell and landed on my left side and was starting to get up when I saw a beautiful, tall blonde come rushing forward to help me. And I don't know if it was the cold, the drink, or the shock but I suddenly blurted out something like: \"You will make some guy very happy someday.\" And then I promptly fell back down, hit my head on the icy sidewalk, and blacked out. \n\nWhen I came to she was standing there, with a thoughtful expression on her face. As I sat up and rubbed the back of my head, I looked at her and then looked down at the pizza slice lying next to me. And she, without missing a beat, picked up the slice and handed it to me. It was then that I knew that this woman would be somebody that I would have to meet again, just so I could take her out to dinner. I took her out for pizza next week and we hit it off immediately. That was 44 years ago, and I still think fondly about that night.\n\nBut these days, most young people don't even bother to meet their potential date, just as long as he or she looks good in a profile picture. It's like they're shopping for a new car on the Internet, only the price is something called \"the compatibility rating.\" It's an impersonal and dehumanizing experience, and I don't think it does anybody any favors. After all, haven't you seen the statistics on divorce in this country? It just shouldn't surprise anyone that over half of all first marriages end in divorce, when young people don't even bother to spend time getting to know one another. Poking and swiping through selfies might work for some people, but what happens when you get off of your phone and get into the real world? Marriage isn't about finding a picture on your screen — it's about finding a person you can trust and love and spend the rest of your life with.\n\nLet's just be real, I never would have met my wife if I had been glued to my phone all the time. I was out enjoying my life in the real world, about to eat a slice of delicious New York pizza, and I hit my head on a patch of ice. And that was all it took for me to dive right into a wonderful, loving relationship. I just don't think that Tinder or Match or JSwipe is going to produce any such results...at least, not for all of us. So in conclusion, I would have to say that I think technology in general, and the so-called \"dating apps\" specifically, are probably not helping our society in any way; the technology probably makes us more isolated, less social creatures, and more shallow as individuals. I don't know if I can make any more sense than that. \n",
