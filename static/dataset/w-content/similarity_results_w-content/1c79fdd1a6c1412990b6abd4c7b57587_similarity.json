        "sentence": "What Are the Most Important Things Students Should Learn in School?\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the most important things students should learn in school is how to interact and get along with their peers. This will allow for them to grow socially so they have a chance of being successful in whatever profession they are interested in pursuing. If they are not able to get along with others, then that same ability will be lacking when they are out in the real world. This, in turn, will make it harder for them to be successful in whatever they are trying to do. Humans are social animals and they need social skills to survive in the society, no matter what profession you are in. So I do not support homeschooling. I do not want to sound mean, but I have seen too much abuse to kids by parents that think they can teach better than the schools. A parent cannot replace a teacher. Also, at home, you lack the setting to imitate the actual society which contains different kinds of people. Therefore, your child might end up not being okay with others. So, I do not think homeschooling is okay because it destroys your so-called social life. \n\nAt school, teachers act like your guardians and the classmates act like someone that you interact with everyday. Students learn to obey authority and the rules set by the school. They interact with their peers while following the school rules, just like adults following the rules set by their workplace. The school will allow your child to experience what it’s like to follow rules everyday like how it should be done in the real world.\n",
