Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, existing sports are already too dangerous. Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable. The question then becomes, what is the most dangerous sport? The likely answer is some kind of combat sport, like boxing, mixed martial arts, or wrestling. The athletes who compete in those sports are risking serious injury and even death, each and every time they step into the ring or onto the mat. Exactly how high the risk is, could be calculated by looking at the number of deaths and serious injuries per year, and the number of participants.\n\nSo, this number would be the upper limit for acceptable risk in a particular sport. It follows that when a new sport is introduced, it should be compared to this upper limit, and if it is more dangerous in terms of injuries or deaths, it should be banned. This could be tricky; for example, in boxing, the risk of death is relatively low, but the risk of brain damage is high. Other dangerous sports reverse this trend. Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.\n\nOf course, a new sport might not have detailed records of injuries and deaths, so it would be necessary to estimate the risk. If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones.\n\nSports are an inherently dangerous activity, and there is no way to eliminate all risk. However, it seems absurd to attempt to ban all dangerous sports, as some people have suggested, because this would begin a disturbing trend of government interference in our lives. The best approach is to set a reasonable limit on the acceptable level of risk, and then to require that all sports stay below that level.\n",
