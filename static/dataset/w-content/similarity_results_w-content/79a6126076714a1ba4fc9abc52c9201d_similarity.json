Humans giving attention to animal suffering does not mean that they or others are giving less attention to human suffering, and in general many of the suffering that affects animals was in part caused primarily by human intervention.

        "sentence": "Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?\n\nWould you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.\n\nWhy do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nI don't strongly believe that it is wrong of people to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering. Humans giving attention to animal suffering does not mean that they or others are giving less attention to human suffering, and in general many of the suffering that affects animals was in part caused primarily by human intervention. For example, humans have destroyed and disrupted many ecosystems around the world, making many animals endangered, and countless others extinct. In addition, humans have hunted many, domesticated others, and primarily see animals as expendable and necessary to be consumed for human benefit. Thus, I feel it is understandable that people will emphasize more with the suffering of animals, as they will feel in part guilty of the actions of humanity as a whole, and saddened by the fact that many animals are ultimately powerless against the actions of humans. \n\nThat being said, I think there effectively is no rule that dictates you must only focus on causes that aim to reduce animal suffering if humans are suffering, just as there is no rule stating you can only focus on eliminating human suffering. People should be generally concerned with all suffering that exists in the world, hopefully by understanding the pain and suffering that animals are going through, but how they go about investing their time is a more complex matter. For some people, it might be more beneficial or a more efficient use of their time to dedicate many hours to aiding a poor family in an impoverished community than say, going and doing some small volunteer work at an animal organization, while others can have alternative experiences. If many work towards a cause, it becomes more likely that the cause is successful. It is then up to a person to chose how they invest their time in the causes they are aware of, and believe in. \n\nOverall, it is understandable that people will emphasize with the suffering of animals, who they deem are powerless and unable to better their situation, than the suffering of humans, whose issues tend to be much grander in scope, and requiring more resources and time to resolve. There might also be a psychological phenomenon at play, where people feel that the suffering of animals is much more obvious compared to that of humans, which might be subtle and not easily disclosed. I would also like to add that there is no reason you should have to choose one cause over the other, as both involve complex issues, and might be connected. As long as people as a society work towards both, it is possible given time that the suffering of humans and animals will be eliminated, improving the welfare of both significantly.\n",
