It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nYou wonder who JFK might be. It couldn't be the JFK, he's dead. Wasn't he buried in Arlington cemetery? You're pretty sure that he was. So you google \"JFK\". His wiki page tells you that yes, he is dead. You look at more results. Half of the results tell you that he is dead, and half tell you to look at more results.\n\nSo you google his wiki page again, to make sure that the first half was right. But the wiki page is gone.\n\nWha...?\n\nYou go to a different site. They've taken down all of JFK's pages. Instead, the redirect is to a page that simple has your picture on it.\n\nBut you are not alone in the picture. Next to you is a the house you grew up in. Your mother's house. You call your mother, but the voice that answers says \"JFK.\" You ask \"How did you get my mother's number?\" and the voice replies \"I know where you live, Barack,\" in a tone that says \"this is not up for discussion.\"\n\nSo you go to your parent's house. The door is open. You walk in to see your mother cooking dinner and JFK sitting at the table. He has a single piece of paper in front of him. He looks up at you and smiles.\n\n\"Please have a seat, Barack. We need to talk about your next move.\"\n\n\"There is no next move,\" says Obama. \"I am retired. I go golfing every day and eat organic cuisine.\"\n\n\"That's not the real you,\" says JFK.\n\n\"It is the real me.\"\n\n\"Don't you want to save the world from certain doom?\"\n\n\"How much does it pay,\" asks Obama.\n\n\"Nothing,\" says JFK.\n\n\"Then piss of,\" says Obama. \"You know it's all about the Benjamins these days.\"\n\nObama turns to walk out. JFK looks at him, then turns to the paper. He stares at it, and then looks up. \"Okay,\" he says, \"you are released. You are free to go.\"\n\nAnd Obama leaves the house, and goes to play golf.\n",
