        "sentence": "What Stereotypical Characters Make You Cringe?\n\nWhat stereotypical characters in books, movies or television shows make you cringe and why? Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, creating offensive stereotypical characters is bad and I would not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone. I think that creating offensive stereotypical characters is bad because it is a form of discrimination. It is a form of discrimination because it is a way of saying that all people who are like the character are bad and stupid. It is also a way of saying that all people who are like the character are not as good as people who are not like the character. But does it really apply to the real world situations? I think that it does not. It is just a way of entertainment and is very superficial. Sadly, it is not a good way of entertainment because it is not realistic. Remember that no two people are born alike. We are all different and unique. We all have different personalities and different ways of thinking, and thus different ways of acting and behaving. Taking all these into consideration, how can someone stereotype a specific group of people? It is impossible. So just stop stereotyping. To conclude, creating offensive stereotypical characters is bad. \n",
