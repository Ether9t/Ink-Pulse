She told her all about the dream, and the two guys, and how weird it made her feel. \"Sounds to me like your brain telling you to hurry up and find a new guy! \" Rachel had laughed, \"I have a new guy friend I'm dying to introduce you to.\" As a matter of fact, how about we all get together after work for a drink?\"\n\nMaggie arrived at the bar a little early. And happened to start chatting with a guy. He seemed nice enough, but she didn't want to make anything awkward for Rachel and her friend so she firmly told the man that she was meeting someone. He pushed a little, but when he heard she was meeting a guy, suddenly backed off. As he walked away she noticed a pendant under his collar that caught her attention, though she couldn't remember why. \n\nMaggie sat there for a moment and tried to figure out why the odd necklace was so familiar, when she saw Rachel and the man enter. She started to wave, but then froze. The man was wearing a sweater, slightly rumpled. But under it was a shirt, that had the exact pattern as the one the man she had just been speaking to had been wearing. \n",
