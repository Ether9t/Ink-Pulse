That can have a negative effect on us if we become too dependent on our devices. Instead, we should allow ourselves to indulge in extra screen time right now. It's a good way to escape the fear and anxiety that we may be feeling. That mobile video game that you used to play just to pass the time might now give you a way of forgetting the current pandemic. \n\nOne way that could help make screen time be more healthy could be using it to connect with your loved ones. Maybe you could play a multiplayer game together. Or maybe you could Skype with them. Those are ways to bring us closer together right now. \n\nYou could even use screen time to help improve yourself right now. You could be using it to try and learn a foreign language. You could use it to make a daily dairy and keep track of a project you are working on. You could use it to learn how to cook a new recipe.\n\nWhen you think of all of the positive ways you can use it right now, it's hard to say that more screen time is a bad thing. It can be a good thing. It can be a healthy thing. It really just comes down to how you use it. It's like most things in life as far as just finding a healthy balance. But remember, this pandemic won't last forever. You can cut back down on screen time later. For now I'd suggest embracing it and just making the most of it. You never know what new interest you may discover or what new skill you may acquire thanks to it. \n",
