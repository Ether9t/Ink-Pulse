Why do you think the way you do?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, not keeping up with the news does not make you a bad person. Now keeping up with the news does make you slightly better but doesn't mean that you are bad if you don't. I think some people don't want to know what is going on and wants to keep up with their own lives and focus on that. And I don't think that is a bad thing at all. As long as they aren't doing anything harmful then they are a perfectly fine citizen in my book. I think a lot of us anyways see what happens on the news and don't do anything different anyways. Which I feel is the same as not knowing what is happening at all. \n\nI do think it is good to be informed though. I wouldn't go as far as to say we have a responsibility as citizens to know what is going on but it isn't bad at all to watch the news. Not only would it make you informed but also may make you do something like donate to a group. \n",
