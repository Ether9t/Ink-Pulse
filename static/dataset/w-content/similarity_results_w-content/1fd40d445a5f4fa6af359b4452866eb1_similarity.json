I have listened to many audiobooks and I have read many books, I think audiobooks free up you body to do tasks that require very little conscious thought while taking in all the information being read to you. For example, I have listened to audiobooks while doing chores around the house, driving, and working out. I can t read a book and do those things. I am able to consume many more books this way. I used to have a huge backlog of books that I wanted to read but never had the time and it just kept growing until audiobooks and sites that offered then started to grow exponentially. I managed to finally get through them all and now I actively seek new ones all the time. I constantly have one on when I'm in the car or before bed. As an added bonus they are great for helping me get to sleep. I honestly cant think of one disadvantage to audiobooks over regular books other then how relaxing it can be to sit outside and read on a nice day. Then again, I could just listen to the book and enjoy the scenery. \nIn my opinion, without any doubt is that audiobooks are superior to regular books on almost every level.\n",
