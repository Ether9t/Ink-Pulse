Billionaires who have the capability to help everyone in the world, they will care more for their own family, friends, and people they know than a random stranger. So if billionaires are unable to help the humans that are already suffering, what more for a person like you, who is just a normal person? What's easier, to feed, to groom, and to play with your dog, or to make sure someone in Africa is needing their basic necessity? I know it's a hard question to answer, but that's the reality. Even if you have spent a lot of time to help someone in Africa, there's still someone, somewhere who is suffering and you will not have the capability to change that.\n\nSo, in my opinion, it's not wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering.
