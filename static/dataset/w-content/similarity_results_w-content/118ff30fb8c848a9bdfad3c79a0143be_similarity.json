No young woman should have to go through that in a school when the school could prevent it by providing access to the products right there at the school. Pads and tampons, in my opinion are similar to first aid items because if one is needed, it is absolutely NEEDED NOW.  First aid items are provided to those who need them in schools so I believe that pads and tampons should be too. They are somehow different because they aren't used by both genders, but to deprive ONE gender of items they literally can't be in public with out would place an unfair burden on females. So in conclusion for all these reasons stated, I definitely believe schools should, without a doubt, be required to provide pads and tampons to the students who need them.\n",
