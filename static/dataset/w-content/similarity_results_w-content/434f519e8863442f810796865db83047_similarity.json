I have a very good friend, we talk just about every day, who I met on a dating app. We didn't continue to date, but we continued to talk. We found that our friendship was missing from our lives, even though we were completely unaware of its possibility before meeting on a dating app. Neither of us would have thought to reach out or see the other person, in any other context, even though we lived in the same place and had similar interests. \n\nDating apps have allowed me to meet a new friend who has likely had a deeper impact on my life than many of my true loves have. I find a lot of upside to dating apps, and very few downsides. Most of the downside to the apps would be if a person is very impatient, and doesn't feel comfortable around other people. These apps only really require one thing of users, something that all participants need to have in common, and that is the ability to keep an open mind and be patient with oneself and others. \n",
