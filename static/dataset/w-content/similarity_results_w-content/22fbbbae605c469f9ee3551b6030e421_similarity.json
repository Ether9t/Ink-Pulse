He is about to give up when he hears a knock at the door. Its delivery guy with my food. He is an odd looking fellow but not in a bad way. He had a symmetrical face but with many noticeable flaws. Like his nose was uneven and crooked but added to his appeal. His eyes were a little far apart but his cheek bones more then compensated for it. Most of all though, it was his personality and mannerisms that was the most attractive thing about him. A lightbulb went off over John's head. It was not his looks that were the issue as he had thought all along but it was his personality. He was constantly trying to change it everytime he shapeshifted. This time John changed into a man who was only slightly better looking then the rest and decided he would just be himself.   \n",

He approaches the women and gets her to agree to a date. He then has dinner with her and she seems to be enjoying john's company this time. They have the dreaded second date and this time it went fantastically. John was asked by her to go on a third date and from there they were eventually married and in this case did live happily ever after.\n",
