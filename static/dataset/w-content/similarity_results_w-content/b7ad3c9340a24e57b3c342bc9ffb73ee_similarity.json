        "sentence": "Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n\nThe first time I felt alive was when I learned I could wield mana.  It gave me hope.  Hope is something that haven't had in a very long time.  I was born in a world where magic was a thing of the past.  When the aliens came and began to wipe people out, the energy from the deaths seemed to cause an awakening.   The power of mana was returning.\n\nI first noticed this by looking at a simple tiny plant.  In our world, many of the plants were wiped out by the aliens.  I don't think it was intentional.  However, something in the alien's bodies seemed to make plants on our plants wither and die.  Last week, I woke up feeling lighter than normal.  My body seemed to float through the air.  I normally feel horrible, but this day was a rare day. \n\n I looked at the plant on my desk and noticed it was growing.  Specifically, it was growing whenever I came near it.  It was noticeable growth.  I had never seen a plant grow this fast.   After coming into contact with the plant, I looked at my hands and noticed a faint glow.  That's when it hit me.  This plant was no ordinary plant.  It was a fabled \"mana spring\".  When full grown, these plants are able to provide large amounts of mana that can by someone who can wield it.  It cannot bond with someone who cannot wield mana.\n\nThe plants must bond with certain mana users in order for the mana users to access the mana.  I was lucky enough to bond with this one.  I realized this one plant would become the start of the humans resistance.  Our lives, which have been bleak for so long, suddenly had a future.  I knew that I had to help the humans fight back against the aliens.  Our resistance starts today. \n",
