In this modern world, a lot of us have very little time to read books, but audiobooks are basically giving us the experience of reading in little chunks of time.

But with an audiobook, I can take in so much more and it's also very entertaining. There's no misconception about what I'm listening to and no misspelling of words based on how I hear them. I'm there to just bask in the conversations knowing I could be learning so much more.\n\nWith audiobooks, you also can multitask. Being at home all the time and working from home, I don't like to be limited to what I can do, and audiobooks allow me to be able to finish my work but also listen at the same time, to pass the time and to learn. With regular books, you need to be concentrated on what you're reading, and I find it exhausting to do that, which is why I end up only reading one book a year! Audiobooks do not make the reader less knowledgeable, but they make them more productive, they can use their time to fall completely in love with the characters and to really understand the meaning of the book.\n\nIt's a common misconception. When adaptation of books have come to TV shows and movies, naysayers say that it's not as good as reading a book because all you focus on is the movie and not the characters in your head. Which is arguably true, if you have a great imagination and a great patience to read a whole book. But unfortunately for many of us, we don't have the time and we get bored and put the book down and would rather watch the movie. It's the same thing with audiobooks, but this time, the details you have are more accurate, they are there to listen to, there are speeches that you can listen to for hours.\n",

Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, audiobooks are definitely better than reading books. In this modern world, a lot of us have very little time to read books, but audiobooks are basically giving us the experience of reading in little chunks of time. Sure people do read books as a hobby and other people are 100% disagreeing with me, but one thing for sure is that you do gain the same benefits from listening to an audiobook as you do from reading a book.\n\nMaybe I do read without taking in too much of what I just read, but sometimes, I get the detail wrong or remember them incorrectly because of a word that I misread, and if I would have just waited and read it later and most likely wrote the word out correctly I would've had a greater understanding. But with an audiobook, I can take in so much more and it's also very entertaining. There's no misconception about what I'm listening to and no misspelling of words based on how I hear them. I'm there to just bask in the conversations knowing I could be learning so much more.\n\nWith audiobooks, you also can multitask. Being at home all the time and working from home, I don't like to be limited to what I can do, and audiobooks allow me to be able to finish my work but also listen at the same time, to pass the time and to learn. With regular books, you need to be concentrated on what you're reading, and I find it exhausting to do that, which is why I end up only reading one book a year! Audiobooks do not make the reader less knowledgeable, but they make them more productive, they can use their time to fall completely in love with the characters and to really understand the meaning of the book.\n\nIt's a common misconception. When adaptation of books have come to TV shows and movies, naysayers say that it's not as good as reading a book because all you focus on is the movie and not the characters in your head. Which is arguably true, if you have a great imagination and a great patience to read a whole book. But unfortunately for many of us, we don't have the time and we get bored and put the book down and would rather watch the movie. It's the same thing with audiobooks, but this time, the details you have are more accurate, they are there to listen to, there are speeches that you can listen to for hours.\n\nSometimes, the author of the book is also the one to read you the audiobook. Not only this is a great way for self-expression, but also a great way for the audience to understand the emotion behind what's being read.
