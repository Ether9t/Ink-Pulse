You're surprised to hear a bee talking. He tells you that he's the bee that your mother ordered to protect you at all costs. You're confused because your mother never mentioned anything about bees. Moreover, why would she order a bee to protect you? You've spent your entire life actively avoiding bees. Your mother has forbidden you to even go near them. Alfred says that your mother had given him orders to protect you all day. He tells you that jobs like these are his specialty. You ask what his job title is and he says he's a \"Guard Bee.\" Well, how about that! You've never even heard of a guard bee before, and now here you are talking to one!\n\nYou ask Alfred why your mother thought you needed his help. He says that your mother worries about you a lot. She ordered Alfred to protect you and make sure you don't do anything stupid. You laugh and ask if he's really going to be able to protect you. \"Try me,\" he says, and flies off your shoulder. You say that you want to go for a bike ride. Alfred says he'll follow you. You ask if he thinks you should pack a picnic lunch too. Alfred says \"Of course!\" So you go to the pantry in your kitchen and you start assembling treats for lunch, including a loaf of bread and a bag of chips. You end up preparing chicken salad sandwiches, tuna salad sandwiches, ham salad sandwiches, and egg salad sandwiches. And you also end up preparing some cookies, some brownies, and some strawberry shortcake. You start to add peanut butter to the brownie batter but Alfred stops you immediately. \"That's not good for you,\" he tells you. You ask why. He says he'll explain it to you later, but for now you should just leave it out of the batter. You comply, but you're a little suspicious.\n\nLater you go on your picnic, with your bike basket loaded up with all your treats and sandwiches. You're about to take off without your helmet but Alfred stops you again. He tells you that there's something important about helmets. You have to wear one. You groan. You can practically hear your mother's voice through Alfred's. You put on your helmet and kick off with Alfred on your shoulder. Later, you get to the picnic park and start munching your treats. You offer Alfred a sandwich, but he says that bees only eat pollen from flowers, not from sandwiches.\n",
