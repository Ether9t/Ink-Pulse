        "sentence": "Should College Athletes Be Paid?\n\nDo you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?\n\nIn “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,\" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\"\n\nDo you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, college athletes should be paid, but not any more than college students in other parts of faculty. There should be a limit on how much the athletes can be paid while enrolled in classes. However, I feel that they should be entitled to royalties on anything particularly made of themselves. The athletes should have to conform to some kind of code of conduct as to not do anything that would tarnish the positive effect they could have over the public. In addition, the coaches should have to follow a code of conduct as well. This means not doing anything that could be considered unethical including coercion of teachers to give the appropriate grades needed to fulfill academic requirements. College athletes should be protected from getting exploited much the same way child models are being protected, as well as their implications for their future job opportunities. All in all, I feel that college should be about an education. The big paychecks should wait until after graduation. Try to make the college years about being young and free of money problems.\n",
