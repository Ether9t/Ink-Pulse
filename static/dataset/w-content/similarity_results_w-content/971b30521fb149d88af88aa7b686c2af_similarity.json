        "sentence": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, sports involve certain degree of danger, so no sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. But I admit that there are lines which should be drawn. Sports should only be played with the consent of every participant; players should have their physical and psychological states tested and certified by qualified specialists. In addition, if there is the possibility of serious injury, insurance should be provided and equipment should be maintained to minimize any harm. In most cases, these suggested conditions have been met satisfactorily, so I don't think that any sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. Sports should also be conducted freely so that the players will have a sense of freedom. Instead of violating the principles of sport, I recommend that we should create education programs to increase awareness of sports and to teach players how to use their skills to prevent accidents in practice or competition. If it is their own choice to participate in a sport, why shouldn’t people be able to voluntarily take on additional risk? Because there are many risks in life, just as there are dangers in sport. However, even if the number of accidents is slightly higher than the number of accidents occurring in other activities, it's a valid idea for athletes to make their own choice. Why can’t the choice make all of those involved feel good? While it is understandable that people are concerned about the risk of injury in sport, shouldn’t we also have feelings about how exciting and attractive sports\n",
