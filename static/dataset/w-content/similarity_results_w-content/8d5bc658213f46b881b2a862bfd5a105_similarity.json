What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, English and math are the most important things to learn in school. They are the most important because almost everything you learn in school revolves around these two subjects. By learning these two subjects, it will help you in life later on. These subjects should be introduced at the earliest age possible. \n\nSome ways they could be introduced at the earliest age possible would be by testing the kids to see where their strengths are and how much more help. Guidance is needed throughout the kids' education to ensure proper learning of English and math. Here and there along the way, help and remediation can be made available.\n\nThe more help that is offered, the better the education for the kids. With strong skill in English and math, students can have futures in almost any field of their choice. These include medical school, law school, engineering, architecture and many more. \n\nThe requirements for college or university may be more flexible if math and English are strong. However, strength in these areas ensures good grades on entrance exams such as the LSAT and MCAT. Thus, this further guarantees their future success.   By learning English and math at an early age, students are given a huge advantage to succeed in life.\n",
