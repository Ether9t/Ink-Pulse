Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?\n\n---\n\nI don't listen to audiobooks. I don't have a problem with them, but I just prefer reading. I think it's because I'm a very visual person. I like to see the words on the page, and I like to see how they look when I read them aloud. I like to see the punctuation and the spacing.\n\nI think it's also because I'm a very fast reader. I can read a book in a day or two, and I don't think I could listen to an audiobook that quickly. I think I would get impatient and want to speed it up. \n\nI also like the fact that I can read a book in any order. I can read it in the order it was written, or I can skip around and read the chapters in any order I want. I can even skip around within chapters. I can read the first paragraph of a chapter, then skip to the last paragraph, then go back to the beginning.\n\nHardcover books don't hurt my ears, and I don't have to worry about recharging my batteries. I already have enough electronic items, that I don't need anything else to get a virus, glitch, or need charging. \n\nI think the only advantage to listening to an audiobook is that you can do other things while you're listening. \n",
