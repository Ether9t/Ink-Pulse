I have also met people in person who I have already known through social media. I have had a lot of good experiences with dating apps. I have met some really great people and I have had some really great dates. \n\nFilms on sites like Netflix have shown us possibilities. It shows us that there are many different ways to be in a relationship. It shows us that there are many different ways to live and to love. It shows us that there are many different ways to be happy. \n\nWith modern technology, we don't have to visit someone in person, or mail them to let them know we're thinking about them. There are thousands of apps and messaging sites we can use.  We can text someone, we can call them, we can send them a picture, we can send them a video, we can send them a song. We can even send them a video of us singing a song! \n\nYes, technology has made it supremely easy to date and improve our romances.  Technology gives love the possibility of existing in new areas, where it could not before. We have more ways to say \"I love you\" than ever!\n\n",
