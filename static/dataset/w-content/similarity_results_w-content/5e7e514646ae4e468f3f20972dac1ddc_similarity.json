She had finally found the man she was looking for. The issue for her is the man was not who she thought he was. He would go to bars and flirt with girls all the time.

She thought things were going perfectly until she saw him in a bar making out with another girl. She confronted him and broke things off and was distraught. \n",

He asked her if they could meet up and she agreed. She wanted to meet a man who comforted her at her most vulnerable. A full year went by and they got along, dated and the man ended up proposing to her. They are scheduled to marry in about 4 months. As for the shapeshifter, he ended up losing that ability and everyone began to see him for what he was. A man who had Napoleon complex and was actually 5 feet 2. He was trying to live a life that he thought he would love but at the end of the day, he forever remained unhappy and unfulfilled. The woman dodged a bullet.\n",
