College athletes are supposed to be students, not professional players. Their first priority should be the academic performance. Being paid to pay sports will distract the students from focusing on their academic, thus ruining the ultimate purpose of attending college. Providing monetary compensation to players gives them a false interpretation that sports are linked to monetary compensation. The meaning of sportsmanship would thus be lost. Due to these downsides in providing monetary compensation to players, I think that athletes should not be paid monetary compensation.\n\n\n",
