She then said, \"I forgive you.\" \n\n\"You do?\" he asked. \"Yes. I forgive you.\" she said. \"Now, I have something to confess to you too. Wait here, and I'll be right back.\" \n\n\"But I don't have much time,\" the man said. \"I know, but I'll be right back.\" she said. \"Just wait here. And...think.\" \n\nShe left the room, and went to the kitchen. She never went back into the room. The man was still sitting there, thinking about his last day on earth. She snuck out to the car and drove away. And he sat there, thinking.  And thinking. He thought of every good thing he'd ever done. He thought of every bad thing he'd ever done. He thought about his wife. He wondered about what she would confess to. He thought about his life. He sat there waiting for death to come, only to be  met with more thoughts and memories. \n\nHe sat there for hours. It was never-ending. He couldn't take it any longer. He got up from the table, and walked out the front door.\n",
