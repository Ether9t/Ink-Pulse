Those are things that no human being would want to go through. The worst part is that all of these human beings who thought they were going to be immortal now know their fate. There is no preventing these side effects. \n\nThe mental anguish and stress those patients are going through is excruciating. Put yourself in their shoes for a minute. Imagine knowing that at a specific point in your life, you are 100% going to have amnesia and therefore forget everything you once remembered. That is a scary thought. \n\nI feel like you'd fear each day would be the day where your memory finally goes. Forgetting something small could cause anxiety and panic. It could make you think that the permanent amnesia has finally arrived. I feel for those souls. All of us humans want to live forever. We're all afraid of the unknown.
