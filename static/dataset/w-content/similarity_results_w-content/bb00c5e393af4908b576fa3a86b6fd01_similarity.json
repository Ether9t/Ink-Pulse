So it's a huge efficiency boost as well as a health precaution, and I have no doubt, Covid or no Covid, that I'll be working from home more and more in the future.  Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram.

Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.\n\nTo reiterate, \n",
