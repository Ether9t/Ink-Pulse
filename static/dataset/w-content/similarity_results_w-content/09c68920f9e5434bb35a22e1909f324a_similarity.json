After all, you've always been curious about the kind of dad you are. When you find it, you're somewhere in the bottom third. You shrug it off as a fluke and go back to your meal. \n\nBut then you notice that your name is no longer on the mug. In its place is the name of a different man. You look at the other mugs and find that your name is removed from all of them. At that moment, a cold chill runs up your spine. You get up from the table and try to call your wife, but she doesn't answer. Who is this guy whose name now replaces yours? The name is Mark Anders. You've never heard of him. He's definitely not a friend of yours. You run through your memory to see if you've forgotten someone. No, you don't know him. You go to your daughter Harper's room and find it empty. You start to panic. Where is she? \n\nWhen you call out for her, a man answers. It's Mark. He is Harper's new stepfather and you've never met him. You are genuinely confused. What happened to your wife, Soeurette? Mark tells you that Soeurette has been cheating on you for the last four years. You are shocked. He tells you Soeurette has been unhappy with your poor parenting skills and that this morning, she finally decided to marry Mark at a shotgun wedding place. You can't believe it. Mark earnestly tells you that he's come to love Harper over the years and has legally adopted her. \n\nYou are heartbroken.\n",
