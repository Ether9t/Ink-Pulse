If you are a doctor, you have an obligation to know what is going on in the world of medicine. If you are a farmer, you have an obligation to know what is going on in the world of agriculture. If you are an actor or writer or singer, you have an obligation to know what is going on in the world of entertainment.  What then if you're an ordinary citizen?\n\nWell, then you have an obligation to know what is going on in the world that might affect you or that of people who might be close to you. If you have children, for example, you have an obligation to know about what's going on in the realm of schooling, so you can properly choose how to educate your children. You also need to know about changes in the law that affect education. You need to know about health crises that your children might be impacted by. Of course, that goes beyond parenting, you also need to know about those things if you have a frail elderly person in your life, or an ailing cousin, or a sibling who cannot take care of themselves, and even for yourself.\n\nIf you work, you need to know about changes in the economy that may impact your job, or political issues to the extent that they could impact the economy.  If you pay taxes , you have an obligation to know about legislation that impacts taxes. If you're a homeowner, you need to know about housing and mortgage issues, and developments related to home maintenance. If you are a tenant, you need to know about rent issues, and if you live in subsidized housing, the happenings in the housing industry also. If you're a professional, you need to know about developments in your field to learn new information in order to improve upon your ability to operate  within it.\n\nI think it's fair to say that engaging with current events can definitely impact your life and the lives of those around you in meaningful way. I can think of many examples from my own life, for instance it's been raining unseasonable amounts here of late, and I prevented cycling into a flood by watching the weather news yesterday. I don't think then, that this is an obligation; it is merely enlightened self-interest.\n",
