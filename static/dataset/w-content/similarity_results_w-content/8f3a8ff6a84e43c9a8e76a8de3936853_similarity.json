I dont think the financial cost would be unbearable but the having them freely available at all times would be priceless to the girls. This would effectively end most period shaming and any other embarrassments that may go along with it. It would just be one less thing a young girl needs to worry about and that in itself is worth any trouble since they have enough worries as it is. I personally remember seeing and hearing stories in middle and high school about girls having issues and it haunted them for the rest of their school days. A majority of those incidents can be prevented with easy access to these essential hygiene products. \n",

I am surprised that it has not already been established nation wide. In fact I am a little disturbed that there is even any controversy over it. To me it a no brainier but then again so is getting vaccinted so I am only one voice in a sea of conflicting opinions. \nAs I have said above, this should not be an issue that has any controversy. It is a necessity for these girls and they need to be freely available at all times. That way they have that sense of security and control over their bodies. \n",
