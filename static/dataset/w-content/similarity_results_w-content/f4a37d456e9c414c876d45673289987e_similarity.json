Sheldon Cooper is a stereotypical smart guy nerd who acts like a robot, the next one: Howard Wolowitz is a stereotypical Jewish American, as well as Rajesh Koothrappali, and Leonard Hofstadter all portray \"nerds\". They are all scientists, and that is a huge stereotype. Then you have Penny, who the stereo typical blonde girl next door that comes off as dumb and clueless.\n\nAs you can see that show is full of \"cringe\" worthy stereotypes, but that adds more to the flavor and humor of the show. That's what makes it worth watching. So I can not say I would not ever watch a show full of stereo typical type characters, because sometimes people take it to personally when it's not meant to be. It's just a show. Enjoy it, and forget your worries and laugh a little bit. I feel we have almost forgotten how to do that.\n",
