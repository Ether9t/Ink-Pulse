        "sentence": "Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" He wondered how he was going to blow down a house made of uranium. He huffed and he puffed and blew real hard. But it didn't work. The house still stood. The wolf was so angry. He decided he must instead blow up the house in order to get to the little pig. So he called up china, who sent him a ton of dynamite. He planned on using it to blow up the little pig's uranium house. So he picked an evening when he thought the pig would be home and he put the dynamite around the house. He lit the fuse and then ran.  \n\nThe 92nd little pig saw the wolf running away from his house. He knew right away what had happened. But little did the wolf know that this special house was impossible to destroy. So it still stood and the little pig was safe. \n\nThe next morning the wolf came back to the little pig's house. He decided the pig was a worthy opponent for building such an indestructible house. \"I won't kill you,\" he told the pig. \"I'll bother a different pig instead.\" And from then on the 92nd little pig lived in peace not to be bothered by the wolf again.  \n",
