He tries to get him to reveal some juicy Hollywood gossip or something. As it turns out, this alien is a huge fan of the Jason Bourne movies in particular, and Hollywood  in general,  and he's eager to find out what Matt Damon or any of his actor friends have been up to lately. The interrogation doesn't go well. Matt Damon remains steadfastly silent. The alien is left with no choice but to put him back in his cell.\n\nBack on Earth, the Space Force is ready. They launch the rescue mission, and intercept the alien ship quickly. It's automated defenses are no match for the advanced weaponry of Earth's Space Force.

But, the alien is easily panicked, and doesn't understand what they're saying, and mistakenly shoots Matt Damon, killing him instantly.\n\nThe alien screws his eyes shut, and waits for the Space Force to kill him in reprisal, but nothing happens.
