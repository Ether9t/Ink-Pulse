The key thing to note is that pads and tampons still have a social stigma associated with them, thus greater care must be taken in their distribution. For example, schools should make sure that pads and tampons are distributed in areas where they are not visibly seen by students, who may ridicule them afterwards for asking for such items. Privacy must be maintained for the female students, as it ensures their comfort and ease in asking for said items. Furthermore, schools should ensure that the female students’ access to such items are as easy as possible, as those with periods may already suffer from pain\n",
