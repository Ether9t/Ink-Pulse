It's a stereotype that needs to die, as it's making the hardworking LGBT actors and actresses that deserve better, while also giving tired-of-the-mark gay actors and actresses that only want to play a great role and be great actors, only to be denied of the chance because they are so easily pigeon-holed in these movies.\n\nSo to summarize my point, let's just remove the gay bestie trope in any form of media from now on. We've had enough and it's time for gay characters to evolve. Make people be LGBT characters just because they can and not because they have to due to a need for a sidekick. It's time to showcase LGBT characters for who they are, and to allow LGBT actors and actresses to be multi-dimensional characters.\n",
