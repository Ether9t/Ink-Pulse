The voice sounds like an old recording of JFK. I knew it, surely this must be a prank, is your first thought. The voice tells you to go to a certain location at a certain time. This would be a security risk, if it were to be taken seriously at all, but it's getting a little weird. \n\nYou decide to process the number through the federal database. You instruct the handlers to keep it between you and them. There are no known links to the number and in fact any previous holders of the number, if they existed, seemed to be scrubbed from history. Now that is something truly bizarre because it would take a very high level of clearance for this to happen. Was this a government number used in black ops now, or in the past? Just what is going on here? \n\nYou decide to research the location and there seems to be nothing out of the ordinary about it. It turns out however that this location has some strange connection to JFK. It was rumoured to be his actual birthplace, though the sources are deemed unreliable. Your curiosity is peaked enough to provoke a random trip to the location, but it was not at the designated time that the number instructed previously. Such a trip should be fine given the secret service detail. \n\nYou arrive at the location and it is nothing but a small house in a small town. You try the number again and to your surprise, it was not an automated system this time. It was someone who sounded just like JFK. You ask him who he is and he simply says \"I'm JFK, I'm the one who sent you the letter.\"\n",

        "sentence": "You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\" It seemed like an obvious prank. Maybe it was your wife or one of the kids? No one seemed to have any clue about this letter and their reactions seemed genuine. Moreover, how did such a thing make it past your secret service detail? That simply could not be explained. You were the most protected man in the world, after all, no anonymous prank letter would even reach you as everything is checked thoroughly at multiple points just for security reasons. \n\nAt first, you don't think much about it. One day you read the letter again, you think about processing it through your intelligence community connections, but this seems a bit paranoid and unwarranted given the limited context. You decide to call the number using one of your personal lines, which are the least monitored. The voice that responds is apparently an automated system.

You called back and the number is no longer in use. There are no other leads despite a brief audit for national security reasons. \n",
