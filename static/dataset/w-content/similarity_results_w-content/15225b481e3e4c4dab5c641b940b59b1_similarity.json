Had you not been bold and followed your dreams you would have been this dog in your last life. Not as bad as being a fly, perhaps, but still not great. Another preview plays. This time you are shown a being of great power living a life of pure joy. You learn that this is the life you could have had if you had fulfilled all of your potential in your previous lives. You are told that you won't actually be seeing your next life as that life is up to you to live. The reason you were brought here is to understand the ramifications that your actions have on your upcoming reincarnations. \n",
