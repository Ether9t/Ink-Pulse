When I listen, I have to pay attention to the narrator and proceed at the pace of the narration. It's easy to imagine the sound of a character while reading, but when I listen the accent and voice are presented to me and I am in that sense captive. As a result, I tend to scrutinize the narrator more because I can enjoy the narrated book less.\n\nSo much of the media we consume is static and pre-recorded: videos, music, movies, TV shows and the like. None allow the consumer to enter into a process of co-creation with the author like reading does. When I watch a movie I am distant, but reading is an act of intimacy in which the reader and author engage. \n\nThe good reader, it is said, reads with a pen in hand. Reading demand attention and engagement in a way that audiobooks never do.\n\nWhat do you think? Let me know @twitter_handle.\n",
