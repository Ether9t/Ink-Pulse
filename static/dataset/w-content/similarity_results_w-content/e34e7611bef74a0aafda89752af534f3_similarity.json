It would appear that nothing too major would affect him in his life, but that was not the case. For John experienced the oddest event one day, one that would bring about adversity in his life.\n\nHis children had gifted him a mug last Father's day, which he cherished and used every day for his morning tea. He liked to drink it to relax before work, and his children were happy whenever they saw him use the mug they bought for him. However, one day they woke up and looked at him funny while he was drinking his tea.\n\n\"You get a new mug Dad?\" asked his daughter, who was at the time only four years old. Puzzled, John replied no. For it was the same mug he drank from every day since last Father's day, a step-up from the plain ceramic mug he used to drink tea from.\n\nTurning the mug around, he noted that his children were indeed correct, the mug he held did not say #1 Dad. In fact it said, #54 Dad. Thinking it was an elaborate prank from his family, John asked his children where his old mug was. They all shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't know. Asking his wife who was heading to work, she seemed as confused as he was regarding the mug, and denied any involvement in the different appearance of the mug.\n\nIn any case, John placed the mug in the sink, and would come back to clean it later. He dropped off his kids at school, and returned back home to get to work. Work went on as normal, but when he went to get his mug from the sink he noticed something bizarre. The mug he placed in the sink now said #50 Dad. It dropped down by 4 numbers, he was sure of it. Growing more confused, he thought someone had broken into his house, but he had found no signs of forced entry, and his mug was in the same place he had set it down. Grabbing the mug, he took a picture of it, and made a post online about how odd it was for his mug to say such a thing. Most applauded him for buying such a novel mug, and did not give his incident any further thought.\n\nHowever, the next day the mug would now say #65 Dad. Like before, John posted the same picture, and people were again amused by the novelty of such a mug. Some even mentioning he had dropped several ranks down, and asked what he did to become worse than he was before.\n\nThe following days would be the same type of incidents. He would post the mug with his new rank, which sometimes did not change at all and on other days were fairly different than the day before. He become well known as the man with the changing mug, and people were genuinely interested in the mug, and the reason for it's weirdness.\n",

Others were skeptical, and claimed John had multiple mugs made, but his friends and family all supported John, and noted he had quite few mugs stored in his house, with most of them being blank. For the remainder of his life, John had become well known to others not for his notoriety or prestige from his actions or efforts, nor from his job and or position in life. He was known for his novel ceramic mug, which reflected his rank in the world, and showed others that indeed someone or some force was ranking all the dads in the world, and maybe there was a way to measure how good a father a person can really be.\n",
