The military need to get passed the alien line and President Damon needs to not be seen. He is equipped but it's a matter of time before he is spotted. The military makes a plan. They send out a land rover. They will get one with the machine gun on top and try to drive and extract President Damon. \n\nThey drive the rover in order to get President Damon while mowing down aliens. But suddenly the gunner is shot leaving no one on the gun. But they make it to President Damon. He has to shoot a few aliens but makes it inside the rover. Courageously President Damon takes over the gunner and mows down the aliens. He gets a higher kill count that the previous gunner! The rover makes it back safely to the shore where President Damon is extracted and makes it safely back to the ship. He leaves behind the rest of the military to fight. But the mission is a success.\n",
