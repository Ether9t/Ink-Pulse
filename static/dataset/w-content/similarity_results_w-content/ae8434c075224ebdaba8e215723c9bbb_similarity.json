Instead of breaking the norm and portraying characters in a more respectful and realistic manner, stereotypical characters are viewed as no more than their stereotypes and often negative traits, which can depict groups of people as inferior or less equal to other groups. Therefore, I believe people should support shows and other content that refrains from implementing stereotypes and stereotypical characters. The benefits from lacking such characters in a story can go a long way, and it is critical for these types of stories to become widespread for people to view all groups as equal, and to avoid stereotyping them for certain traits or qualities. There are plenty of movies, books, and shows that are good depiction of realistic characters, that the reader or viewer can relate to. These content can delve into serious topics and otherwise heavy themes and messages, but will still respect the viewer by not demeaning specific groups using stereotypes. I think as time goes on, the support people show for these types of content will become more widespread, and be the main preference over shows that have stereotypical characters.\n",
