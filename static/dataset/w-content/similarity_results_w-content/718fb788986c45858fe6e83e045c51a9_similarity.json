        "sentence": "Is Listening to a Book Just as Good as Reading It?\n\nDo you listen to audiobooks? What are the benefits, in your opinion, of listening instead of reading? Are there advantages to reading that cannot be gained by listening? Which method do you prefer? Why?\n\n---\n\nI love listening to Audiobooks. It is wonderful to listen while doing something else, instead of the usual staring at a page. Surprisingly, it still allows you to absorb the story richly and in the same ways as with reading. The voices of the narrators are so captivating that you begin to almost forget the fact that it's a book, and you are only listening to it and not reading it.\n\nI would definitely recommend it to others who feel like they don't have the time to read or would prefer to listen than read. In my opinion, it's just as good, if not better, to listen to than reading the physical copy. \n\nThe voice actors bring the characters to life and take the book to a whole different level. The ability to read in various accents and with different voice levels are only some of the features you get which you wouldn't experience otherwise. \n\nI've read hundreds of books in my life, and find that there is a metamorphosis when reading an audiobook. Your mind allows you to visualize the story as if you were watching a movie, and each actor's voice is unique in its presentation - that becomes an added feature you cannot get with a physical book.\n\nAudiobooks have all the benefits of hardcopy books, and even more flexibility. You can carry around a whole library in your pocket on an mp3 player and can listen to it at the gym, commuting, and multitask with whatever else you may have to do. You are able to be involved in a book, wile doing chores, working out, or cooking. \n\nAudiobooks can intrigue children in a way regular books never can. The young reader can listen to the words in their own voice and that of the narrator's, making them feel more comfortable with spoken language. It also enables them to read along with each character. Audiobooks encourage children to join the book themselves by creating character voices, moving their lips as the characters move theirs, and sneaking a peek at the pictures whenever the scene changes!\n\nAudiobooks are accessible. Any book in the library may be obtained as an audiobook, and there is no waiting list. \nAudiobooks are also considerably less expensive than print books. A popular print book can cost $15-$20 at the library or other bookstore, but a popular audiobook costs less than $10. There are also numerous free audiobooks in various formats available through our public library. \n\nAudiobooks allow you to consume more printed material and explore more subjects than you would otherwise. For example, you might read a magazine article or other short text in your own time, but with audiobooks you can consume a much broader topic while you're doing something else. You could be listening to a book on beekeeping while you're driving to work, and in the process learn audibly about other books and current issues. \n\nAudiobooks make an excellent gift, and can be a great tool for personal growth. The level of character detail, enhanced storytelling, ease of access, and flexibility of Audiobooks make them the clear winner!\n",
