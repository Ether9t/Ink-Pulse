In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it is not wrong to focus on Animal Welfare when human beings are suffering.   It is a fact that animals are suffering more than humans.  Human beings are encroaching on the habitat of animals.  We are running them out of their homes.  Humans are also harming and killing animals.   You have cosmetic and pharmaceutical companies that are using animals for experiments.  Humans harm animals more than animals harm humans.  I think it is only right to put more of a focus on animal suffering than human suffering.\n\nI do not believe we should show no sympathy to human suffering.  I just believe that animals deserve more of our sympathy than humans.  I think it is wrong to focus on human suffering when animals are suffering more.   Morally, I believe this is the right thing to do.  You place more of a focus where there is a greater need.   \n\nI think many people are empathetic towards animal suffering because they understand that human beings have endangered many of these animals.  These animals are just trying to survive.   Humans are taking away their homes and food.  If you look at wolves in certain areas of the world, you will see that they are killed by humans if they attack the human's livestock.   These wolves are just doing what is natural to them.  It is the humans fault for decreasing the territories of many of these animals.\n\nAnimals feel pain just like humans do.  They feel fear and trauma.  I think that humans have a duty to prevent as much harm against animals as possible.   I know it can be hard to put an animal over a human being because we have so many personal interactions with humans.  But, we also have personal interactions with our wildlife.  We have a duty to protect them.\n",
