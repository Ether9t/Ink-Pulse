Murder, war, divorce, famine-how many were caused by a breakdown in communication-how many problems could we solve with better communication and empathy? \n\nBy far, the most important thing I have learned in school, or life in general, is how to communicate with other people. I had a teacher who genuinely cared about her students, and emphasized really listening to each other. She taught us how to listen to each other, and how to speak in a way that would be heard. She taught us how to be respectful of each other, and how to be honest with each other. She taught us how to be empathetic towards each other, and how to be kind to each other. She taught us how to be good friends, and how to be good family members.\n\nHow has this knowledge affected my life? It has made my life much better. I have learned how to communicate with other people, and I have learned how to listen to them. I avoided many problems that would have happened, had I not truly been listening. I avoided hurting people by asking myself how they would feel.   I avoided many fights by listening to what the other person was saying, and trying to understand their point of view. \n\nThis empathetic perspective, and ability to communicate with others has served me well. I have a good job, and I am happy.  I have good friends, and I have a good family. I have a good life, and I owe it to my ability to communicate with other people.\n\nAs long as I am able to communicate with others, I will have a good life in the future. These skills are the most important thing I learned in school,  and are key to my success in life. \n",
