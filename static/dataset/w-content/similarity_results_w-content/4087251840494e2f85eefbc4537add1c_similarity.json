In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it is not at all wrong to focus on animal welfare! Humans and animals suffer in many of the same ways. Many animals fear death as much as humans do.  The disparity in power in the relationship is what makes animal abuse worse. \n\nAnimals don't have the level of consciousness or physical power that humans have. If they could, I believe they would fight and scream and try to escape pain, just as we do. If animals could speak, I am sure they would tell us that they feel pain and not to cause them anymore harm. But they can't. This difference in power is exactly the same as the basis for the immorality of child abuse-someone in position of strength is taking advantage of the helpless, or those who don't know better. \n\nOn some level, humans are more able to empathize with a helpless being, such as animal. Understandably, we feel bad when we see a dog or cat that has been abused. We can feel like it was us being hurt, and we can almost see ourselves in their situation. We put ourselves in a position of a powerless animal, and try to help and save them. \n\nWith human abuse, though, there is the issue of complexity and doubt. Did the human do something to deserve being beaten? Was there a sin they are being punished for? Did they strike the other person first? Humans are able to reason, think critically, and express themselves with words. Can't they defend themselves? \n\nThis doubt, consequence, and human religion is what makes a clear difference between human and animal abuse. Humans hurting humans can be retaliation, justice, or any other reason. With humans hurting animals, it's much more frequently the strong human using their power to hurt an often innocent and helpless animal.   Animal abuse is more frequently wrong, and therefore, more widely condemned. \n",
