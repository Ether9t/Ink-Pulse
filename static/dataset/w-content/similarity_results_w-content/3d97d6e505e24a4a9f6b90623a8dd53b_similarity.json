Of course the Secret Service would be listening in, and this was the quickest way to find out who was behind this all. But when the other line picked up, there was no voice, just a soft beeping.

We play by the rules, so this time and place is off limits.\"\n\n\"But, but, I don't understand.\" You look to JFK. Bluntly \"You're dead.\"\n\nHe looked at you, with a bit of a hard glint in his eye. \"Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm also not. Now's not the time to be slow and over think things. You need to prepare yourself.\"\n\nYou started to feel a bit uneasy now, though Clinton was patting you on the shoulder with a sympathetic look in his eye. The car finally stopped, in what looked like an empty field in the middle of nowhere. And then it appeared. \n\n\"THAT is an ALIEN SPACESHIP!\" Internal alarm bells rang, and you turned to run.
