She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.\n\nOne day, she receives an email from someone new. Since she has a lot of time on her hands, she decides to meet him for coffee. The last guy stopped answering her calls, and she was hopeful. \n\nWhen she arrives to the coffee shop, her date already has a cup in front of him. She walks over to the table. \n\n\"This is for you.\" he says, pointing at the cup.  \"What about you?\" she asks. \"Don't you want a drink too?\" \n\n\"Oh, I don't need one.\" he replies. \"I just had one last week.\" \"That's odd,\" she thought.
