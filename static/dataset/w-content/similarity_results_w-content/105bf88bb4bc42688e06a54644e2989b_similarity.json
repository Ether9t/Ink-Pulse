You are absolutely happy that justice was served in this incident, although Soeurette's death puts a damper on how you are feeling and makes you feel guilty all over again for having allowed this all to happen to her. However, you know you are taking baby steps toward rectifying this situation for Soeurette. So you will count this experience of going to court on her behalf as a total win and will not let anyone else tell you otherwise. \n",
