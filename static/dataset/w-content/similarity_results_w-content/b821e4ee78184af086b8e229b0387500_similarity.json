The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.\n\nThe final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches.

The witches try their hardest to hold onto their broom but they slip and fall into the fire pit and are never heard from again. Will help saved his community and all the members within it.
