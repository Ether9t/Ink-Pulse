You often will have stereotypical African Americans and homosexuals. In general it does not come down to if a character is stereotypical for me. It really comes down to if the show, book or movie surrounding the character is good. One example is modern family. It has a very stereotypical view of homosexuals but I like many other aspects of the show so it's okay.\n\n\n",

Sometimes stereotypes are needed for specific types of comedies. A show like Reno 911 is a good example.
