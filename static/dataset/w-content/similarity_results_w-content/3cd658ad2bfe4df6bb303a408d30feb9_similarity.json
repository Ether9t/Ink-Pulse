So, we should be trying to learn as much as possible about these technologies now and how they can be used to improve our lives. We should also be paying attention to the opposite. What is not working and how we can go about fixing it. Finally, it is my conclusion that adults should use this time to really engage with digital technologies to learn what works and what does not. You just need to be mindful of what you are using your screen for. Dont feel guilty either if you spend an extra hour or two playing games or on social media every once in a great while but as I suggested above, we need to focus more on productivity and expanding our skill sets. \n",
