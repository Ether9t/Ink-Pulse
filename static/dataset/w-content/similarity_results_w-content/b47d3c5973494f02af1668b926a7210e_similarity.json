Nevertheless, you are happy to them be with the new incarnation, and to see how close they are to them as they grow up. You also feel slightly envious, given that you never knew your own parents, who died in a car accident when you were two years old. You then see that your new incarnation has siblings as well, an older brother who is a year older than them, and an older sister that is 5 years older than the incarnation. You ponder more about your own life. Did you have siblings, and if so were you separated with the death of your parents? Your thoughts turn to your other reincarnations, were they also orphans with no siblings, or did they have families that took care of them since birth. Putting your thoughts aside, you continue watching as see your incarnation grow up throughout the years.\n\nYou see them grow up to be a teenager, and you see them become more and more distant from their family. You see their relationship with friends, lovers, and others enter turbulent times, and see their own struggles with their mental health.

Soon, the screen grows dark, and you realize that you will soon watch the next life of the newest reincarnation. You are saddened by this, as you have grown attached to the new incarnation, and had hoped they would have lived a longer life than you did. Turning to your left, you see the incarnation now sitting by you. They are shocked and suprised, like your were in the past. \n",
