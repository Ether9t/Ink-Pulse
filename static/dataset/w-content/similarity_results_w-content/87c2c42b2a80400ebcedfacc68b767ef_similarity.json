So your movie is taking a bit of time, and of course you had to watch all of the other yous' movies as well. \n\nThe movies you see are not particularly interesting or exciting ones. But they were decent lives. And there were lessons to be learned from them. Which is the whole point after all. \n\nWhen the movie ends, you are once again in blackness. When the lights come up you see most of the ones in the audience focused on you. Ah, it must be up to you then. Your turn. \n\nYou look around and find the one who looks different than the rest. Right up front, all alone, and apprehensive rather than satisfied or disappointed. That is you. Again. And maybe even better this time. \n\nYou approach them gently. You smile. \"Hello. I hope this wasn't all too much?\"  They smile back at you, but are still a bit worried.\n\n\"I, I don't know what to say. I don't know anything, but I saw so much happen, and what does it all mean?\"\n\n\"Ha, well, that is the big question. I'm not sure I found the answer to it during my turn, but maybe you'll have better luck. I hope we've managed to teach you something. I hope we've managed to make things a little better for you this time around.\"\n\nThey looked even more worried, \"But I don't know how, I mean what, I mean....\"\n\nYou take their hand gently and start to lead them up out of the seats, \"Don't worry. You're not supposed to \"know\" anything. You're at the very beginning of your very own life. But we are all linked and are always here for you, in the back of your mind.\"\n",
