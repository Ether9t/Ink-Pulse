        "sentence": "Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. It was the power to be able to control aliens! \n\nThe survivors are able to harness this power and fight back against the aliens. However, most decided just to have fun with it instead. They begin turning the aliens into their slaves. The aliens are forced to do all of the work, while the humans sit back and relax. They mow the yard, cook the meals and even are the drivers for humans. \n\nThe aliens are not too happy about this. They themselves realize they have their own mana that works in a similar way. It would give them the power to control humans, overriding the humans mana powers. They begin to search for a way to harness their own mana. They eventually realize that they need to kill many of their own kind so that the survivors have a stronger mana force. Half of the aliens end up volunteering and overnight, the aliens now have the upper hand. \n\nThe aliens begin getting their revenge. They force the humans to do all of the work, while they sit back and relax. They aren't interested in killing the humans anymore. They now just want to put them through the same punishments and humiliate them. \n\nThe humans are not happy about this. They need to get the power back. They begin searching for a way to harness their mana again. They then come to the same conclusion as the aliens. They need to wipe out half of the remaining humans to regain control with their mana. The humans aren't eager to volunteer so half of the humans end up killing the other half. \n\nThis continues back and forth. One side takes control and then the other wipes out half of their population until both sides have hardly anyone left. \n\nThe aliens and humans are now at a stalemate. This has to stop somewhere. Neither side wants to completely give in so they try to figure out a compromise. They agree that they will alternate between being each others slaves. Humans are the slaves for three days, then the aliens. It's crazy enough that it just might work. \n",
