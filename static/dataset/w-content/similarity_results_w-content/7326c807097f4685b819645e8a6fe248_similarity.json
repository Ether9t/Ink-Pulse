What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the math and the sciences are the most important things students should learn in school. My biology teacher have said that the things you learn in math class aren't used in the real world and she may be biased because she was teaching biology, but mathematics as a subject is very important.

Without mathematics, we would not have the mental knowledge how to build computers, artificial intelligence, devices, and so much more.\n\nThe sciences are also a vast majority of topics, and the same thing with mathematics, is that it is a very essential part of learning and pathways to a successful future. In these current times with the pandemic, the world is in need of more scientists to find a cure, and without the sciences, they would not be able to do so.\n\nBut there's one thing that I have been noticing over the years and something that I regret talking about. Human empathy, compassion, and love for one another has been lacking in our communities for the past few years. Don't get me wrong, we have our heroes such as our healthcare workers, teachers, and police officers, but there's something that we are lacking in our society. People are protesting against mask mandates, against the vaccine, and against various heath protocols. But not only that, people are also being killed, being yelled at, and being discriminated against. I think that in school, there should be something that we teach about these things and so the future generation do not have to go through the same things that we are going through.\n",
