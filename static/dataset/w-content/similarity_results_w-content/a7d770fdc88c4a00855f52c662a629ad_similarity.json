A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\"\n\nDo you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, college players should earn their money through hard work.  I think it's unfair for people who get a free ride (college scholarship) while people who worked just as hard working their way through college, have to pay back debt.  It leads to favoritism in college sports. College sports superstars are treated differently than other students, and they might not even deserve it. They get more breaks from their teachers so they pass no matter the amount of work they put in. Furthermore, they are given special treatment that other students aren't given access to. College is meant to be about hard work, and the ability to succeed all without money being thrown at you. These college athletes are getting money thrown at them, the ability to travel with the team, and media attention that people who work hard to succeed don't get. They do the minimal work to pass class and practice for football, and then get rewarded for their talent. I can't think of many cases where a student would receive more money than needed to live off of for college. Having more than their peers is unfair and not moral. It goes against the values that are instilled in college students. Students work hard for what they earn, and they should be treated just like everyone else. They are free to reap the benefits of their celebrity status after graduation.  Until then, they should not be treated differently than anyone else. Colleges should strive to have more egalitarian values. \n",
