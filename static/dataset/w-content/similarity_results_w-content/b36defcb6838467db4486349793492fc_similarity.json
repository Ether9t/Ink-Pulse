        "sentence": "When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 29, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nThe drug seems to be working. People don't die from anything. No disease. Nothing physical. Not even aging. Humans can survive everything. But there's a catch. People are going insane. The drug has created a new mental disorder, called \"The Madness\". People are a lot more aggressive. People are a lot more mean. They lack empathy. They have less morality.\n\nIt is effecting the world big time. Lots more fights, shootings, terrorism. The government made a mistake. They didn't realize that the drug would make people act like animals. And now the government has to do something. \n\nThe government has decided to take the drug away. A new drug was made to reverse the side effects of the drug and is the only way a human can die again. The government deems the drug a failure. So they have decided to give everyone the new drug. But there are going to be a lot of people who aren't going to willingly take this new drug. They are addicted to The Madness. The government decides to do something big and risky. They have decided to put the drug is a sort of \"bomb\" and \"bomb\" the cities. Not explosives but as a way of spreading the drug and force people to take it. They will also use planes with the drug and spray the air and let people inhale the drug.\n\nAnd I so happen to be a military pilot. My mission is to help distribute the drug to major cities. I have been given a plane and a crew. I have been given a list of cities to bomb. I have 72 hours to hit as many cities as possible. I get on my mission and it is a success. All around the country people are losing The Madness. The side effect of the new drug is no more immortality. But the government sees this as a win. They have taken back control of the country. Not everyone is cured but the rest can be taken care of.\n",
