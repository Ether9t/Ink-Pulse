For many in the past, it was not expected that one could know anything that was going on beyond their country or community, given the lack of technology such as the internet, social media, or even television and other types of viewing devices. Traditional media in those eras, such as newspapers were often locally controlled, and opinionated from a particular point of view that did not encompass all the perspectives and opinions prevalent in the world at the time. While people could be argued to be better informed of the local events that would affect them, today I believe people are much more informed of what is occurring all around the world. As a result of various factors, we might feel we have a greater responsibility to keep up all types of events, even ones that occur internationally alongside with local and national events. However, such a feat is difficult if not impossible for many citizens of the world.\n\nOne reason for a potential inability to deal with the amount of information out there, is a result of time scarcity. For most people have obligations to account for, in addition to taking the time to get informed and stay up to date with current news and events. Some have less time to keep up with the news, spending a lot of their waking time at work and other obligations. Others can have more free time to stay informed, which in too can lead to other actions such as political engagement and activism. The citizens with less time on their hands to keep up with the news are not necessarily worse than those that do, nor would I consider them bad citizens. In fact, I don't think it is possible for many to keep up with all current events, however I believe it is still their duty to at least stay informed regarding certain news and topics. \n\nA person that has a basic awareness of events that occur in the world can accomplish a lot more than they might believe. Even basic awareness can help by preventing events from being devastating, or circumstances being harmful. For this basic awareness people have coincides with the possibility they will spread what they know to others, and inform people of what events they are up to date with. With the prevalence of technology, this means people will know about the news more readily, especially with the impact of social media in connecting people with relevant information.\n",
