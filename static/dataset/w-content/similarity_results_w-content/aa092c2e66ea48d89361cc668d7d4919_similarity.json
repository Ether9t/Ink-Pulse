In this life, I work at a big hospital, as a well respected surgeon, quite the difference from being a lawyer previously. This person is getting ready to perform a surgery on a small child.

It makes me wonder how my children and wife are doing, knowing that I have died. I understand that it is no longer about my past life, but about my reincarnated self. I am no longer worried about my loved ones, because I know that they will be fine. I feel a little bit at peace with myself, knowing that they will be taken care of. I continue to watch the movie in front of me, hoping that my reincarnated self with have a great life. When I was watching this movie, I noticed that the life of my reincarnated self seemed to be an improvement from my past life. This self was more extroverted and daring, which was the complete opposite of myself. This person was living a life that I would have wanted to live, and it seems as though everything is going well. He seems to have a lot going for him, a great family, kids, the works. I am no longer upset about my death, because I know that my reincarnated self is living a much better life. I decided to stand up from my seat and walk out of the cinema, to see what waited for me on the outside. I walk outside, and I am shocked to see that the cinema which I was previously in was no longer there. In front of me was a beautiful city filled with skyscrapers and people going on with their daily routines. The architecture was built out of beautiful, golden, steel, brick and marble. \n",

You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.\n\nI don't remember how I got here, in this dimly lit, heavenly cinema with all of these people.  I try hard to remember what happened previously by asking the people in the cinema where we are. The person in front of me turns around and says \"be quiet, the show is about to start\".  To my surprise, the person in front of me looks similar to me, but with a subtle difference in facial structure. I turn around to the people behind me, but they all seem to look like my past reincarnations. I soon realize and remember, that I died in a tragic car accident at the age of 36. I was driving home after my birthday party, and a drunken driver crashed into my car. Even though I was wearing my seatbelt, I did not survive such an impact. Suddenly, I begin watching a movie on the big screen in front of me. The man in the movie is a reincarnation of myself, but with subtle differences. I soon realize that this movie is about to start my new life. It feels odd to watch yourself live a life from the outside. The life on the big screen in front of me is similar to my previous life, but with subtle differences. In this life, I work at a big hospital, as a well respected surgeon, quite the difference from being a lawyer previously. This person is getting ready to perform a surgery on a small child. I remember that I used to take my children to a petting zoo when they were small. I always loved looking at them experience new things. It makes me wonder how my children and wife are doing, knowing that I have died. I understand that it is no longer about my past life, but about my reincarnated self. I am no longer worried about my loved ones, because I know that they will be fine. I feel a little bit at peace with myself, knowing that they will be taken care of. I continue to watch the movie in front of me, hoping that my reincarnated self with have a great life. When I was watching this movie, I noticed that the life of my reincarnated self seemed to be an improvement from my past life. This self was more extroverted and daring, which was the complete opposite of myself. This person was living a life that I would have wanted to live, and it seems as though everything is going well. He seems to have a lot going for him, a great family, kids, the works. I am no longer upset about my death, because I know that my reincarnated self is living a much better life. I decided to stand up from my seat and walk out of the cinema, to see what waited for me on the outside. I walk outside, and I am shocked to see that the cinema which I was previously in was no longer there. In front of me was a beautiful city filled with skyscrapers and people going on with their daily routines. The architecture was built out of beautiful, golden, steel, brick and marble. The streets were clean and people were smiling and waving at me. Soon after, a man approached me, who went by the name Peter. I quickly understood that this man was Saint Peter, the gatekeeper. He offered to take me on a tour and to meet the person in charge. We walked for what seemed to be an hour in the wonderful city. Finally, we reached a set of giant, golden doors. I immediately knew that this was where the creator of our world resided. I was never much for the belief in an almighty being, but I guess I was wrong. The doors open and Peter points me in the direction of the creator. I walk up to the creator and I am both in awe and surprised. The creator is a woman, not a man as we were taught on Earth. She tells me that I lived a good life, with people who loved and respected me. It made me feel better about the whole situation. She continues to tell me that I can choose to continue my life, or I can choose to go back and restart my life again. It was a tempting offer, to go back to Earth and live with my loving family, but I know that it was the wrong decision. I enjoyed my life for what it was and now it was someone else's turn to live their life in my body. \n",

I try hard to remember what happened previously by asking the people in the cinema where we are. The person in front of me turns around and says \"be quiet, the show is about to start\".  To my surprise, the person in front of me looks similar to me, but with a subtle difference in facial structure. I turn around to the people behind me, but they all seem to look like my past reincarnations. I soon realize and remember, that I died in a tragic car accident at the age of 36. I was driving home after my birthday party, and a drunken driver crashed into my car. Even though I was wearing my seatbelt, I did not survive such an impact. Suddenly, I begin watching a movie on the big screen in front of me. The man in the movie is a reincarnation of myself, but with subtle differences. I soon realize that this movie is about to start my new life. It feels odd to watch yourself live a life from the outside. The life on the big screen in front of me is similar to my previous life, but with subtle differences. In this life, I work at a big hospital, as a well respected surgeon, quite the difference from being a lawyer previously. This person is getting ready to perform a surgery on a small child. I remember that I used to take my children to a petting zoo when they were small. I always loved looking at them experience new things. It makes me wonder how my children and wife are doing, knowing that I have died. I understand that it is no longer about my past life, but about my reincarnated self. I am no longer worried about my loved ones, because I know that they will be fine. I feel a little bit at peace with myself, knowing that they will be taken care of. I continue to watch the movie in front of me, hoping that my reincarnated self with have a great life. When I was watching this movie, I noticed that the life of my reincarnated self seemed to be an improvement from my past life. This self was more extroverted and daring, which was the complete opposite of myself. This person was living a life that I would have wanted to live, and it seems as though everything is going well. He seems to have a lot going for him, a great family, kids, the works. I am no longer upset about my death, because I know that my reincarnated self is living a much better life. I decided to stand up from my seat and walk out of the cinema, to see what waited for me on the outside. I walk outside, and I am shocked to see that the cinema which I was previously in was no longer there. In front of me was a beautiful city filled with skyscrapers and people going on with their daily routines. The architecture was built out of beautiful, golden, steel, brick and marble. The streets were clean and people were smiling and waving at me. Soon after, a man approached me, who went by the name Peter. I quickly understood that this man was Saint Peter, the gatekeeper. He offered to take me on a tour and to meet the person in charge. We walked for what seemed to be an hour in the wonderful city. Finally, we reached a set of giant, golden doors. I immediately knew that this was where the creator of our world resided. I was never much for the belief in an almighty being, but I guess I was wrong. The doors open and Peter points me in the direction of the creator. I walk up to the creator and I am both in awe and surprised. The creator is a woman, not a man as we were taught on Earth. She tells me that I lived a good life, with people who loved and respected me. It made me feel better about the whole situation. She continues to tell me that I can choose to continue my life, or I can choose to go back and restart my life again. It was a tempting offer, to go back to Earth and live with my loving family, but I know that it was the wrong decision. I enjoyed my life for what it was and now it was someone else's turn to live their life in my body. I tell the creator that I would like to continue my life, because I felt as though I could make a difference in this world. She smiles and sends me on my way back to the city. Peter then takes me to my residence and gives me a job. I know that I have chosen the right life, and it will be a pleasure to live it. I know that I can make a difference here and help people. Instead of being a lawyer, I have been chosen to be a doctor, like my reincarnated self. It is nerve wracking and exciting at the same time. I never had a problem with blood and I was always interested in medicine. Maybe it was why my reincarnated self became a doctor and not a boring lawyer. I am happy that I get a second chance to do something exciting and more fulfilling in this new life. I know that one day I will be with my family again, and we will be happy here. My time on Earth came and went, and for that I will always be grateful to have had the opportunity to experience a mortal life.\n",
