The number isn't the important aspect of the mug. The meaning behind the mug is what's important. Most of these mugs are given to dad's by their children. And as long as your child gifts you a #1 Dad mug, that's all that matters. \n\nIf your child considers you to be the best Dad in the world, simply put...nobody else's opinion matters at all. We all strive to be the best parent that we can possibly be. Getting that reaffirmation and love from our children means everything. \n\nThe Dads learned a lesson because of the changing of the mugs. They all realized that at the end of the day, rankings don't matter. Your family and your children matter. Prioritize them at all times. \n",
