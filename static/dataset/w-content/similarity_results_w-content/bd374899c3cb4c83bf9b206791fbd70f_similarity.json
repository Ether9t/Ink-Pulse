The portrayal of mentally ill persons in the media is usually negative and inaccurate. Even sometimes it is offensive and misleading.  Films from the 90s and early 2000s such as Girl, Interrupted and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are examples of this. Mental illness is often something people deal struggle with internally, while these films portray the mentally ill as violent, dangerous and unpredictable, often resorting to institutionalizing the affected person. \n\nIn the film Girl, Interrupted, Susanna Kaysen is a young woman who is institutionalized after a suicide attempt. During the film, she encounters every stereotype of the mentally ill person to an extreme. Now if a person identifies with having a similar illness as one of these characters, it is assumed they will be as extreme as a movie character. This is not the case. These characters are not realistic portrayals of the mentally ill. By speaking openly about mental illness, we can help to break down these stereotypes. The more open we are about the true nature of mental illness, the more we can help to dispel the myths and stereotypes.\n",
