I think the crux of learning independence and responsibility comes from learning personal finance. I think it is important for students to learn how to manage their money and how to make good financial decisions. It's interesting, though, because most schools don't teach personal finance. In fact, most schools don't even teach economics. This is really unfortunate because plenty of students in America graduate high school without knowing how to balance a checkbook. This is a problem because they are going to be making financial decisions for the rest of their lives. And if they don't know how to manage their money, they are going to be making bad financial decisions. It's just going to be so problematic for the country if we have a bunch of financially illiterate adults. We already have a debt problem in this country. Did you know that the average American household has more than $15,000 in credit card debt? And that's not even counting student loans. So if we have a bunch of financially illiterate adults, we are going to have a lot more debt in this country. Debt could really threaten the future of the country, because if people don't have money to spend, then the economy is going to suffer. So I think that personal finance should be taught in schools. Even elementary school kids should be learning about money.  For example, they could have some play money to buy little toys with from a classroom store, and then they would be forced to learn about budgeting and saving. They could earn the play money through exhibiting good behavior. Then, when they get to middle school, they should be learning about how to manage their money in a more advanced manner. For example, a classroom activity could simulate taking out loans. And when they get to high school, they should be learning about personal finance in an even more advanced manner. For example, they could be given a budget and then they would have to figure out how to spend their money in a way that would allow them to not only pay for college tuition but also their future kids' expenses and their retirement. \n\nThe most important thing that I learned in school was how to be a good writer. This is unfortunate because I don't think that writing is the most important thing that students should learn. As I stated previously,  personal finance should be the topic that is most important to learn about.

Did you know that the average American household has more than $15,000 in credit card debt? And that's not even counting student loans. So if we have a bunch of financially illiterate adults, we are going to have a lot more debt in this country. Debt could really threaten the future of the country, because if people don't have money to spend, then the economy is going to suffer. So I think that personal finance should be taught in schools. Even elementary school kids should be learning about money.  For example, they could have some play money to buy little toys with from a classroom store, and then they would be forced to learn about budgeting and saving. They could earn the play money through exhibiting good behavior. Then, when they get to middle school, they should be learning about how to manage their money in a more advanced manner. For example, a classroom activity could simulate taking out loans. And when they get to high school, they should be learning about personal finance in an even more advanced manner. For example, they could be given a budget and then they would have to figure out how to spend their money in a way that would allow them to not only pay for college tuition but also their future kids' expenses and their retirement. \n\nThe most important thing that I learned in school was how to be a good writer. This is unfortunate because I don't think that writing is the most important thing that students should learn. As I stated previously,  personal finance should be the topic that is most important to learn about. I genuinely don't think I learned much that really affected my life or that will be helpful to me in the future, because I don't think I learned anything that will help me in my career. I'm not a writer by any means and in my job as a line cook, I don't need to be a good writer. All I need to do is follow recipes and cook food. I can definitely do that without being a good writer, and it doesn't take a genius to grill a hamburger or make a grilled cheese sandwich. But honestly, as a line cook I definitely have problems budgeting my money. I don't make a lot of money, so I have to be really careful with how I spend it. And it would have been invaluable \n",

What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, students should learn how to be independent and responsible. I think the crux of learning independence and responsibility comes from learning personal finance. I think it is important for students to learn how to manage their money and how to make good financial decisions. It's interesting, though, because most schools don't teach personal finance. In fact, most schools don't even teach economics. This is really unfortunate because plenty of students in America graduate high school without knowing how to balance a checkbook. This is a problem because they are going to be making financial decisions for the rest of their lives. And if they don't know how to manage their money, they are going to be making bad financial decisions. It's just going to be so problematic for the country if we have a bunch of financially illiterate adults. We already have a debt problem in this country. Did you know that the average American household has more than $15,000 in credit card debt? And that's not even counting student loans. So if we have a bunch of financially illiterate adults, we are going to have a lot more debt in this country. Debt could really threaten the future of the country, because if people don't have money to spend, then the economy is going to suffer. So I think that personal finance should be taught in schools. Even elementary school kids should be learning about money.  For example, they could have some play money to buy little toys with from a classroom store, and then they would be forced to learn about budgeting and saving. They could earn the play money through exhibiting good behavior. Then, when they get to middle school, they should be learning about how to manage their money in a more advanced manner. For example, a classroom activity could simulate taking out loans. And when they get to high school, they should be learning about personal finance in an even more advanced manner. For example, they could be given a budget and then they would have to figure out how to spend their money in a way that would allow them to not only pay for college tuition but also their future kids' expenses and their retirement. \n\nThe most important thing that I learned in school was how to be a good writer. This is unfortunate because I don't think that writing is the most important thing that students should learn. As I stated previously,  personal finance should be the topic that is most important to learn about. I genuinely don't think I learned much that really affected my life or that will be helpful to me in the future, because I don't think I learned anything that will help me in my career. I'm not a writer by any means and in my job as a line cook, I don't need to be a good writer. All I need to do is follow recipes and cook food. I can definitely do that without being a good writer, and it doesn't take a genius to grill a hamburger or make a grilled cheese sandwich. But honestly, as a line cook I definitely have problems budgeting my money. I don't make a lot of money, so I have to be really careful with how I spend it. And it would have been invaluable to me to learn about personal finance in school. Now, all I can do is try to learn about it on my own. That's obviously really hard and I don't think I'm doing a very good job of it. So that is why I am making the case for personal finance to be taught in schools. It can really \n",
