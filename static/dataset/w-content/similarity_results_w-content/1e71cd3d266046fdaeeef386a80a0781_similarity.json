They develop a chamber made of a material that can contain mana, and a brave individual volunteers to remain inside.  This chamber is called the Transference Chamber. The volunteer who will receive all the mana, will be known as the Conduit.\n\nSo as alien bombardment continues, and the situation growing increasingly perilous, mana flows into the Transference Chamber, and the Conduit absorbs it. The effects are rapid. The Conduit rapidly begins to evolve, becoming a Mana user capable of superhuman feats of magic. These powers grow as the mana exposure continues, and very quickly, he reaches a level of power that might be sufficient to tap. The experimenters release him from the Transference Chamber.\n\n\n",
