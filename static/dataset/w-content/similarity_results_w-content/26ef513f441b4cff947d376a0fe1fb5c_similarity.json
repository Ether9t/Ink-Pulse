In fact, not providing them is arguably a case of sex discrimination, since all other essentials are supplied.

But this does not argue against providing the supplies. Since it is a biological basic necessity, it is not a matter of choice. The same is true for toilet paper, soap, and other products. This really means that not providing these supplies is ignoring a group's basic needs while needs that apply to all students are supplied. It also suggests that those making these types of decisions were not thinking about it and not consulting with those who use the bathrooms. \n\nTo suggest that money is an issue here is to miss the point, because if the school can afford to supply other basic necessities such as indigestion medicine, toilet paper, soap, hand dryers, and tylenol, then pads and tampons fall into the same category and should be paid for from the same budget. School students also have to rely on adults for at least most of their money, since they cannot be employed if they are under the employment age, and if they are old enough to work they cannot work more than 20 hours per week. Many students' families cannot afford everything they need and rely on the school to meet them partway by providing basic needs during the school day. In conclusion, yes, school should supply sanitary products for students. \n",
