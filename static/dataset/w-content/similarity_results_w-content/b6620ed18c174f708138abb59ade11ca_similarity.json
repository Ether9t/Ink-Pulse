Kids are playing video games where it's not uncommon to kill several hundred virtual people, in a single night. The movies that they are watching, and the characters they are learning to idolize, are also centered around killing and violence. \n\nI think that this is causing a lot of people to lose their sense of empathy. They are becoming desensitized to the suffering of others. I think that this is a very dangerous trend. Learning why killing is wrong has to be a cornerstone of childhood. Our society is going the other way. \n\nI'm not saying that we should ban violent movies, but I think that we should be more selective about what we allow our children to watch We can't do that when characters like Deadpool are enticing us with a cutesy personality, but a deadly disposition. It's confusing to adults, and dangerous for children. I'm not suggesting that all of this type of entertainment is a bad thing, but I am stating that it's dangerous to create a society that is all consumed with this content. I hope that, in the future, we can do better.\n",
