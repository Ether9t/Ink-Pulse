This dog's grooming, care, feeding and love can take priority to a human child's illness and care. The animal in this case gets more financial support, better housing, and better living condition than a human child that is for example living in a third world country, with little or no resources.\n\nThis celebrity has done nothing wrong in particular, in fact, caring and loving an animal is a wonderful act. However, humans should not forget that there are humans suffering right now in this very same world, that deserve our attention too.\n\nCaring and loving our own, in the long run, will also be beneficial to the animal's existence in the world, as we take care of humanity as a whole, this would also ensure that the animals are safe,  as we have a healthier and safer society. Because a healthy and a safe society do not torture animals, and have enough resources to take care of them as humanity is not behind on their own need.\n\nSo yeah, it is never a contest whether you should care for humans or care for non-human animal lives in the world, we are all interconnected, and in this interconnected world we should try to take care of our own first, with it meaning not necessarily neglecting animal care, as we all know animal care will be a positive side effect in the long run, of a healthier and more resourceful humanity.\n\nThe first thing to do is make sure that we would all survive in the years to come. And how we do that is to first combat climate change, a big thing that is already harming animals and plants on this planet, and look forward to caring for everyone and everything. We need to be empathetic and aware of our impact on the planet, and the impact of our actions worldwide in other humans, animals and ecosystems.\n",
