It didn't bother you much, as the cool breeze outside would enter the house and make it a bit fresher. However, as you sat doing your homework, you ended up hearing a buzzing noise. At first, it didn't occur to you that it was a bee. Flies would often enter the house from the open windows, so you expected one to be buzzing around your room, much to your annoyance. However, the buzzing soon got closer, until you saw where it came from. It was a honeybee, flying around your room, looking for something to pollinate. There were no flowers in your room, but you still got scared by the sight of the bee being so close to you. You were frozen with fear, believing that if you ran away, the bee might end up stinging you from your sudden movement. You would have to wait, and hope that the bee would fly out the window, to find flowers elsewhere.\n\nThe bee had found its way around the room, until it landed on your desk. It crawled onto your textbook, and began moving across the page. You thought of closing the book, killing it in the process, but your were overcome with a sense of curiosity. The bee was small, and didn't look like it could hurt you. You continued to watch it move across the page, and against your better judgement, placed your hand on your textbook. Soon enough, the bee climbed onto your hand. It was warm, and you could feel its tiny body moving. You expected it to sting you, but it never did. Standing up, you then moved out of your room and went outside your house. You saw a flower in bloom, and walked over to it. Moving your hand closer to the flower, you decided to let the bee walk off your hand to get to the flower. Sure enough, the bee moved onto the flower, and began eating its nectar while pollinating it as well. Happy to help the bee, you decided to walk back into the house. \n\nFrom that day on, you started walking around outside more often. You were less afraid of bees, given your past experience with a very friendly bee. Although you still took precautions to prevent one from ever stinging you, you didn't let fear paralyze you as much as it did when you first learned you were allergic to bees. You would often walk near fields of flowers, admiring the site while thinking to yourself whether bees would soon arrive to pollinate them. You realized for the most part, bees would take care of themselves, and not bother you too much.\n",

        "sentence": "As a child, you were always happy to spend time outside, playing in the grass and with friends. However, as you grew this became much more difficult for you, as you ended up becoming allergic to bees when you turned 15. It became hard to spend too much time outside, especially whenever bees were out and about pollinating the flowers in bloom. You tried not to let it bother you, but it was hard when your friends would go outside to play, while you would have to sit at home. Just the idea of getting stung by a bee would bring an immense fear in you, as the first time it would happen since you turned 15, you ended up going to the hospital from the allergic reaction that occurred. You didn’t want to be in that situation again, so you sat at home, catching up on your homework, and soon after watching TV.\n\nThe window was ajar, given how hot the house would get during the spring.
