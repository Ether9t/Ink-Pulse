        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the shapeshifter's plan to replace the groom and the twist involving the child potentially inheriting shapeshifting abilities. However, it lacks deep exploration of these concepts, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the shapeshifter's actions to the child's abilities, which affects the flow. Thus, the coherence score is also a 3."
