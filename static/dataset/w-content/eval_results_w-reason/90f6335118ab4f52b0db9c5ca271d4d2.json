        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to other hygienic items like Band-Aids and the emphasis on privacy and respect in distribution. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep exploration beyond the introduction. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that progresses logically from the need for free pads and tampons to the importance of privacy and the potential negative outcomes of not providing these items. The article maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, contributing to its coherence score."
