        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is an original and creative idea. The concept of the pig being unusually large and strong due to radiation exposure adds a unique angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence of the article is strong, with a clear narrative progression from the wolf's initial plan to the realization of his mistake and subsequent retreat. The transitions between the wolf's actions and thoughts are smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone, justifying a coherence score of 4."
