        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article provides a standard critique of the portrayal of mental illness in media, specifically citing 'Girl, Interrupted' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' as examples. While it highlights the negative stereotypes and the impact on public perception, these are common points in discussions about mental health representation. Thus, the idea score is a 3 for standard ideas with some development. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing specific examples and then moving to a broader conclusion about the need for open discussion to dispel myths. However, the transition from specific examples to the broader conclusion could be smoother, leading to a coherence score of 3."
