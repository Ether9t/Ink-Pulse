        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on the concept of immortality by introducing the idea of a new form of natural selection where only the 'pure' and 'undamaged' survive. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, which focused on the societal impact of the drug. The article effectively expands on the introduction by illustrating the physical and societal consequences of the drug's side effects, such as the inability to handle pain and the dramatic death of the 'immortals.' However, it could delve deeper into the implications of this new natural selection process. The coherence is strong, with a logical progression from personal experiences to broader societal observations. The transition from the doctor's office to the park scene is smooth, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout. However, there are minor areas where the narrative could be tightened for even greater cohesion."
