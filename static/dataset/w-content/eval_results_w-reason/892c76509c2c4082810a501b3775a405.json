        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of granting miracles and the responsibility that comes with it, which is a common theme in discussions about divine intervention and human imperfection. It does not introduce particularly novel insights beyond the introduction, hence the idea score of 3. The coherence score is also 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, it occasionally shifts focus abruptly, such as moving from discussing the responsibility of granting miracles to the nature of human flaws and reincarnation without smooth transitions."
