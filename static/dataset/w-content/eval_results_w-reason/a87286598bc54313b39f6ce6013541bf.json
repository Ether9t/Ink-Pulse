        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat shallow expansion of the introduction's premise. The idea of using a GPS-like device to locate the Keystones is a standard concept and doesn't offer much originality beyond the introduction. The twist with the battery change is a minor development but doesn't significantly enhance the narrative. Thus, the idea score is 2. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following the journey to find the Keystones and the eventual restoration of humanity. However, the transition from the difficulty in finding the fourth Keystone to its eventual discovery is abrupt, and the resolution feels rushed. Therefore, the coherence score is 3."
