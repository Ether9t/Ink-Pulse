        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that extreme sports are necessary for pushing human limits and that safety obsession can stifle potential. However, it lacks deep exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing extreme sports to criticizing e-sports. The tone is consistent, but the argument could be more logically structured and refined."
