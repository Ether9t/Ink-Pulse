        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that college athletes should play for the love of the sport and the potential negative impact on education and team dynamics if athletes are paid. These ideas are not particularly novel but are developed with some depth. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of arguments, such as the discussion of scholarships as a form of payment and the potential unfairness to non-athletic students. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas, which limits the idea score to a 3. The coherence score is a 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and smooth transitions throughout, though it could be slightly more refined to achieve a perfect score."
