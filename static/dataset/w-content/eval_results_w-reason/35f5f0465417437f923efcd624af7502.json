        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of a bee army misunderstanding human hospitals and attempting to rescue the protagonist, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of the protagonist being a bee-controlled robot adds another layer of originality, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence is lacking, as the narrative jumps abruptly from the hospital chaos to the protagonist's realization of their bee identity, and then to leading a bee revolution. These transitions are jarring and disrupt the flow, resulting in a coherence score of 2."
