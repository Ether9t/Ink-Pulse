        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding how technology affects dating, such as improved connectivity and communication. However, it lacks novel insights or original angles, which is why it scores a 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is a 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It maintains logical flow and consistency, discussing personal experiences before transitioning into broader observations about technology's impact on dating."
