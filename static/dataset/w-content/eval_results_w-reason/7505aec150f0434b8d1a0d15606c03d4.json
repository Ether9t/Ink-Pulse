        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of former presidents, led by JFK, working in a secret group called the 'C-Team' to combat supernatural and extraterrestrial threats. This concept is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a coherent narrative, with a logical progression from receiving the letter to being transported to a space station. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the style is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4. However, the article could have provided more depth in the description of the C-Team's mission or the technology used, which would have enhanced both the idea and coherence scores."
