        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and uses a rocket-propelled grenade. This is a clear new insight and a creative expansion beyond the introduction, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the Big Bad Elephant gang and the quick escalation to using a grenade, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
