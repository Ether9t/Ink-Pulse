        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the revelation of the protagonist's royal destiny and the mother's protective lie. However, it lacks deeper exploration or multiple original ideas beyond the initial premise. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the bee's revelation to the protagonist's conversation with her mother. The article could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed exploration of the protagonist's emotions and future implications of her newfound knowledge."
