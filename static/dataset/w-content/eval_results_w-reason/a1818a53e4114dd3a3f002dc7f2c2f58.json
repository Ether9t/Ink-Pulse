        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and creative idea of Barack Obama teaming up with a future robotic JFK to save humanity from alien invaders using a time crystal. This is a unique and imaginative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions and a lack of detailed development in certain parts, such as the sudden success of the mission and the immediate resolution of the conflict."
