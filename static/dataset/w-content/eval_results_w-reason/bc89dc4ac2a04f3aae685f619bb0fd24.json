        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by exploring the societal and personal repercussions of the immortality drug's side effects, which were not detailed in the introduction. It delves into the emotional and practical impacts on both the 'immortal' generation and the protagonist, offering a novel angle on the consequences of such a drug. The idea of a workforce suddenly aging and the protagonist's realization of impending loneliness are strong original ideas. Coherence is well-maintained with a logical progression from the news revelation to the protagonist's personal situation, though there are minor transitions that could be smoother, such as the abrupt shift from the news to the protagonist's personal reflection. Overall, the article is well-structured and maintains a consistent style."
