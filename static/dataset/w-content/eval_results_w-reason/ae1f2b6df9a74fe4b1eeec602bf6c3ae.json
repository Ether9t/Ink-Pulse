        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the differences between listening to audiobooks and reading. It discusses the level of interaction and the role of the reader's imagination versus the voice artist's interpretation, which are common points in this debate. However, it does not introduce particularly novel insights or angles beyond these standard observations, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from discussing the differences to the benefits and drawbacks of each method. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout, justifying a coherence score of 4."
