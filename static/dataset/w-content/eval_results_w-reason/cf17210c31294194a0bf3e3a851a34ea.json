        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat novel idea by introducing a mysterious scenario involving JFK and Obama, which is an interesting twist. However, the development of this idea is limited, as it quickly shifts to a humorous and somewhat superficial exchange without deeper exploration of the implications or the mystery. Thus, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally consistent tone and logical progression, but there are abrupt transitions, such as the sudden appearance of the 'tall man with orange skin,' which disrupts the flow. Therefore, it also scores a 3 for coherence."
