        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a twist where the cure for immortality's side effects also rejuvenates the 'Lost Generation,' which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This earns it a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the mix-up in the lab and the quick resolution of the global issue, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
