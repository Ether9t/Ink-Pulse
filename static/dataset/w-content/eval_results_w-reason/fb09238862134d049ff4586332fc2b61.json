        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat standard argument that humans anthropomorphize animals and prioritize human welfare over animal welfare. However, it lacks depth and originality, as it mainly reiterates common viewpoints without offering new insights or novel angles, resulting in a score of 2 for New Idea. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shift from discussing anthropomorphism to the natural cycle of life, which affects the flow. Therefore, it receives a score of 3 for Coherence."
