        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing menstrual products to other hygiene products like toilet paper and soap, which are already provided in schools. This comparison is a common argument in discussions about providing free menstrual products, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas, moving from the legal context to personal anecdotes and logical arguments, which justifies a coherence score of 4. The transitions between points are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed throughout the article."
