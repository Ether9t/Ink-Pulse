        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that screen time will decrease post-pandemic as people return to face-to-face interactions. This is a common perspective and not particularly novel, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. However, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of thoughts. It logically transitions from discussing the temporary nature of increased screen time to the benefits of digital devices, earning a coherence score of 4. The article maintains a consistent style and logical flow throughout."
