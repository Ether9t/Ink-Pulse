        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative impact of stereotypical characters in media. It discusses how these characters are often lazily written, perpetuate negative stereotypes, and can lead to dehumanization of certain groups. However, it doesn't offer many new insights or novel angles beyond these points, which are commonly discussed in media criticism. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains a logical flow from the introduction of the problem to the personal stance of avoiding such media, and finally to a call for better representation. Transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains stylistic consistency throughout."
