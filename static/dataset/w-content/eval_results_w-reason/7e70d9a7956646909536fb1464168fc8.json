        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a fragmented and shallow expansion of the introduction's premise. It reiterates the same cycle of Soeurette failing to recognize Matt, the shapeshifter, without offering new insights or exploring the shapeshifter concept in depth. The narrative focuses on Soeurette's character flaws and repetitive relationship failures, which are predictable and lack originality. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a generally coherent narrative structure, following a chronological sequence of events. However, it occasionally feels uneven, particularly in its abrupt moral conclusion, which doesn't naturally arise from the preceding narrative."
