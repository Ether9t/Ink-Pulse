This perspective offers a novel angle on the screen time debate, moving beyond the typical concerns to a broader historical context. Therefore, it scores a 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression from historical examples to future possibilities, maintaining a consistent tone and style. However, the transition to speculative future scenarios could be smoother, which is why it scores a 4 for coherence."
