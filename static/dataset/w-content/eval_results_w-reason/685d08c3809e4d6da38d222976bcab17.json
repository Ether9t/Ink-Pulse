        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the portrayal of Asians in Western media. It highlights common stereotypes such as Asians being portrayed as smart but socially awkward, and Asian men being depicted as effeminate. While these observations are valid, they are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence the idea score of 3. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing Asian men to Asian women without a clear transition. This results in a coherence score of 3."
