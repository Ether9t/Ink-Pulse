        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative impacts of excessive screen time, such as loss of social interaction, potential damage to hearing and speech development, and a lack of empathy. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated and expanded upon with examples, such as children not playing in playgrounds and the impact on human interaction. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It consistently builds on the central theme of concern over screen time, using examples and personal anecdotes to support its points, resulting in a well-structured and clear narrative."
