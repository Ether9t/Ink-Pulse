        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other essential items like toilet paper and paper towels, and suggesting educational measures to reduce period shaming. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights into the topic of period poverty or the implications of providing free menstrual products in schools. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing period poverty to suggesting educational pamphlets. Overall, the article is coherent but could benefit from more structured argumentation and deeper exploration of new ideas."
