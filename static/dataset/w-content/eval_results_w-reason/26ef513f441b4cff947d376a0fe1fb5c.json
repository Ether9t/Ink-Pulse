        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other necessities like toilet paper and soap, and discussing the health implications of not providing them. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond these comparisons. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, logical progression of arguments. It maintains a consistent style and transitions smoothly between points, such as moving from the necessity argument to the health implications and then addressing potential financial concerns."
