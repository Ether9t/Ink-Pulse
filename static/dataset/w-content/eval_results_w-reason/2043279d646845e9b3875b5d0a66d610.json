        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the shapeshifter trope by exploring the emotional and psychological implications of dating the same person in different forms. This adds depth beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The narrative effectively builds suspense and curiosity, particularly with the dream sequence and the realization of the pendant's significance. However, the resolution could have been more developed to fully explore the implications of Maggie's decision. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from Maggie's dream to her realization and confrontation with the shapeshifter. The transitions between scenes are smooth, and the dialogue is natural, contributing to a score of 4 for coherence. Some minor unevenness in pacing, particularly towards the end, prevents a perfect score."
