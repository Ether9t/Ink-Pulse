        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article scores a 2 for New Idea because it primarily follows a predictable narrative without introducing significant new insights or creative expansions beyond the introduction. The concept of a shapeshifter trying to win over a woman by learning her preferences is not deeply explored or expanded with unique twists. For Coherence, the article scores a 4 as it maintains a logical structure and natural progression throughout the date scenario. The transitions from the restaurant to the beach proposal are smooth, and the stylistic consistency is maintained, making the narrative easy to follow."
