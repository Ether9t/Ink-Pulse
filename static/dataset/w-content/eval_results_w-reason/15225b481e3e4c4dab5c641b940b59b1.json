        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on reincarnation by using the metaphor of a cinema to explore potential past and future lives. It introduces the concept of previews as a way to reflect on the consequences of past actions, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This earns it a high idea score of 4. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from one preview to the next, each building on the theme of choices affecting reincarnation. The transitions between previews are smooth, and the overall message is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
