        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that college athletes should receive nominal monetary compensation, which is a common argument in the debate about paying college athletes. The suggestion to pay a nominal amount to avoid a bidding war is a practical angle, but not particularly novel. Therefore, the idea score is 3. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a clear structure, but it lacks depth in its argumentation and transitions between points could be smoother. The reasoning is straightforward but could benefit from more detailed exploration of potential challenges and benefits, leading to a coherence score of 3."
