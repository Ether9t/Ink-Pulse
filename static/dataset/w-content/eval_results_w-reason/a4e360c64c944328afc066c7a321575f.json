        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing the concept of watching a movie of one's next life and having the opportunity to edit it, which adds a unique twist to the reincarnation theme. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is well-maintained with a logical progression from the initial confusion of the protagonist to the revelation of the editing opportunity. The dialogue with the elderly version of the protagonist provides a smooth transition and adds depth to the narrative. However, there are minor areas where the flow could be slightly more refined, such as the abrupt transition back to the movie after the conversation, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
