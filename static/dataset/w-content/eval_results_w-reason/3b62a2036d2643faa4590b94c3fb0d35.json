        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the importance of understanding the American democratic system. It highlights the consequences of ignorance about the system, using the example of beliefs surrounding Trump's election and potential reinstatement. While the idea is not particularly novel, it is relevant and developed with specific examples. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that logically progresses from the importance of understanding the system to the consequences of ignorance. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
