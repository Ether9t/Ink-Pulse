        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents several new ideas beyond the introduction, such as the development of hadronium as a revolutionary fuel source and its impact on global politics, which is a novel angle. The geopolitical changes, like Canada's acquisition of Alaska and the Anti-War Pact of 2300, also add depth to the narrative. These elements contribute to a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally well-structured, with a logical progression from America's isolation to its re-entry into global affairs and the subsequent geopolitical shifts. The transitions between topics are mostly smooth, though there are minor jumps, such as the sudden mention of climate change affecting Canada, which slightly disrupts the flow. Overall, the article maintains a clear and natural progression, earning a coherence score of 4."
