        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. The concept of a shapeshifter trying to find love by being themselves is a slight twist on the typical shapeshifter narrative, but it doesn't delve deeply into new insights or novel angles, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence of the article is strong, with a well-structured narrative that follows the shapeshifter's journey and emotional development. The transitions between the shapeshifter's attempts and eventual self-discovery are smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone, justifying a coherence score of 4."
