        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the protagonist's unexpected royal lineage and the twist of being unable to transform into a bee. However, it doesn't delve deeply into these concepts or explore them in a particularly novel way, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the protagonist's confrontation with the Bee King to the resolution with his mother. This results in a coherence score of 3."
