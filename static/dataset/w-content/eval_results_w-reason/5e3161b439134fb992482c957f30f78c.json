        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of individual engagement in democracy and the power of collective action, which are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that progresses logically from the responsibility of individuals to the impact of collective action, supported by examples like the U.S. presidential election and environmental issues. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
