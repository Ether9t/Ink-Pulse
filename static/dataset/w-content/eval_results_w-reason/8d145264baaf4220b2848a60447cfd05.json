        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is an original and creative idea. The concept of the wolf waiting for the pig to be cooked by radiation is also a unique angle, contributing to the high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the fox and the wolf's quick decision to use a Geiger counter. These elements could have been more smoothly integrated to enhance the overall flow."
