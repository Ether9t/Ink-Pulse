        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a house made of depleted uranium, which is an unusual and creative twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story. This adds a new dimension to the narrative, as it explores the wolf's struggle with an indestructible house, which is a fresh angle beyond the introduction. Therefore, it scores a 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, detailing the wolf's attempts to break in and the pig's subsequent relief. The transitions between the wolf's actions and the pig's reactions are smooth, though there are minor instances where the dialogue could be more polished. Overall, it scores a 4 for coherence."
