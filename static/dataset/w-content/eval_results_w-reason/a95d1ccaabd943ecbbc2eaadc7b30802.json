        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that music education is important, which is a well-known concept. However, it does offer some development by suggesting that music should be mandatory and that students should be matched to their ideal instrument, which adds a bit of depth. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, discussing the benefits of music education and how it should be implemented. However, the suggestion that students who don't appreciate music should go to a separate school is an abrupt shift that affects the flow. Thus, it scores a 3 for coherence."
