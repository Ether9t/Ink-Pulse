        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by emphasizing the importance of teaching independence in school, which is not a common focus in discussions about education. The author provides personal anecdotes and examples, such as the freedom given by Mrs. Hensley, to illustrate how independence can be fostered in students. This adds depth and originality to the discussion. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with smooth transitions between personal experiences and broader reflections on education. However, there are minor instances where the narrative could be more tightly woven, such as the abrupt mention of calculus and trigonometry, which slightly disrupts the flow."
