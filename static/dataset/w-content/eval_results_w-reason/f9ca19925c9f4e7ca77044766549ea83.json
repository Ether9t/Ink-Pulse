        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of balancing screen time with other activities and the potential benefits of screen use, like improved hand-eye coordination. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression. It transitions smoothly from discussing adult screen time to focusing on children's screen time, and then to practical advice on balancing screen use with other activities. The stylistic consistency is maintained throughout, contributing to a well-structured piece."
