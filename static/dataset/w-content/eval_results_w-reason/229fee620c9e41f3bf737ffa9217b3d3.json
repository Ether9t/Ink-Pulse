        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of the side effect of the immortality drug causing people to regress in age, eventually becoming children and babies. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, which only mentioned the discovery of side effects. The concept of the 'Lost Generation' having to care for these regressed individuals adds depth to the narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article maintains a generally logical structure, it lacks detailed transitions and development in some areas. The progression from war to caregiving is abrupt, and the article could benefit from more elaboration on the societal implications and personal experiences of the narrator."
