        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that paying college athletes would commercialize college sports and devalue education. It also touches on the notion that college is not a job and should remain a place for learning and personal growth. However, these points are not particularly novel or deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression of arguments. It maintains a consistent tone and logical flow, earning a score of 4. The transitions between points are generally smooth, though there could be more depth in exploring counterarguments or alternative perspectives."
