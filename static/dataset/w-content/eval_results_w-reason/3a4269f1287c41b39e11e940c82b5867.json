        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the shapeshifter's realization that his approach to dating was flawed. It introduces the concept of a mentor figure, Ted, who provides guidance, which adds some depth to the narrative. However, it doesn't significantly expand beyond the introduction's premise. The coherence is strong, with a clear and logical progression from Bill's initial thoughts to his conversation with Ted and eventual decision to move on. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
