        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by comparing the U.S. college sports system to Australia's, suggesting that adopting a similar model could benefit student-athletes. This comparison is a novel angle that goes beyond the introduction's discussion. The article also discusses the potential for endorsements and the broader societal benefits of paying athletes, which adds depth to the argument. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article is generally coherent, there are some transitions that feel abrupt, such as the shift from discussing Australia's system to the potential benefits in the U.S. without a clear connecting statement. Overall, the article is well-structured but could benefit from smoother transitions."
