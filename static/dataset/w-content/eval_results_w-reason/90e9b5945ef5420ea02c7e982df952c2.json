        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing depleted uranium as a building material and the wolf's attempts with dynamite and grenades. This adds a creative angle, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. However, the story doesn't deeply explore these concepts, limiting its originality. Coherence is generally maintained, with a clear sequence of events and logical progression from the wolf's attempts to blow up the house to sharing sandwiches. However, the abrupt ending where the wolf eats the pig feels slightly jarring, preventing a higher coherence score."
