        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by focusing on the 92nd little pig, who discovers an abandoned castle and becomes its king. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, offering a fresh narrative about finding a home and building a community. The idea of the pig finding a castle and turning it into a home is a clear new insight, meriting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured, with a logical progression from the pig's discovery of the castle to becoming its ruler. The transitions between the pig's exploration, discovery, and eventual settlement are smooth, though there are minor inconsistencies in tone, such as the abrupt mention of the pig's ancestors. Overall, the article maintains a clear and natural progression, justifying a coherence score of 4."
