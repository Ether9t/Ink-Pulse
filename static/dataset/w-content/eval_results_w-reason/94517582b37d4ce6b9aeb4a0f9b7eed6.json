        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a 92nd pig with a house made of depleted uranium, which is a creative and humorous concept. The wolf's use of modern technology, like YouTube and Facebook, to strategize adds a fresh angle to the traditional tale. The collaboration between the wolf and the pig's brothers to blow down the house is another inventive idea, leading to a new alliance against the 94th pig. These elements contribute to a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the wolf's initial failure to the eventual success with the help of the pig's brothers. The transitions between the wolf's research, the failed attempts, and the final collaboration are smooth, though there are minor instances where the flow could be slightly more refined, such as the abrupt shift from the wolf's solo efforts to the group collaboration. Overall, the article is well-structured, earning a coherence score of 4."
