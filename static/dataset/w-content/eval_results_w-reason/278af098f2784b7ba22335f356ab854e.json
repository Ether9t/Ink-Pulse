        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the introduction with the revelation that the protagonist is not allergic to bees and is actually a banished bee royalty. This twist adds depth and creativity, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a coherent narrative with logical progression from the protagonist's disbelief to the acceptance of their role as queen, with smooth transitions between dialogue and exposition. However, some parts, like the joke about 'unbee-lievable,' slightly disrupt the tone, preventing a perfect score. Overall, the article is well-structured and engaging, justifying a coherence score of 4."
