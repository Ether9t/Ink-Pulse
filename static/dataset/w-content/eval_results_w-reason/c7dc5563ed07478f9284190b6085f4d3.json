        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the division of screen time into information, social connection, and entertainment, and the potential integration of screen functions with the physical world through AI and AR. These ideas are not particularly novel but are developed beyond the introduction. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing the purposes of screen time, the physical implications, and future possibilities. The transitions are smooth, and the article is stylistically consistent."
