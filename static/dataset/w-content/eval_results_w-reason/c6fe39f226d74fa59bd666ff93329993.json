        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a few ideas, such as the financial constraints of schools and the potential misuse of free pads and tampons by students. However, these ideas are not deeply explored or supported with evidence, resulting in a fragmented and shallow presentation. The argument that girls should be responsible for their own hygiene products is not novel and lacks depth. The coherence of the article is also lacking, as it jumps from one point to another without smooth transitions, such as moving from financial concerns to behavioral assumptions about boys. The tone is inconsistent, with a mix of personal opinion and unsupported claims, leading to a disjointed reading experience."
