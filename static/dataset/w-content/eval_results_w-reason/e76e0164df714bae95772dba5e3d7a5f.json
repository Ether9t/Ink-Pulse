        "reason": "The article presents some standard ideas with a bit of development, such as the critique of stereotypical portrayals of young, beautiful couples and the call for more realistic representations of diverse relationships and appearances. However, these ideas are not particularly novel, as they echo common criticisms of media portrayals. The suggestion to cast 'normal' people and theater geeks is a slightly fresher angle, but not deeply explored. Coherence-wise, the article maintains a general logical structure, discussing different aspects of stereotypes in media, but it occasionally lacks smooth transitions between points, such as the abrupt shift from discussing young couples to the impact of COVID-19 on grooming habits. Overall, the article is generally coherent but could benefit from more seamless transitions and deeper exploration of its ideas."
