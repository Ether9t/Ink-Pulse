        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the impact of technology on real-world interactions and the importance of physical presence in relationships. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, discussing both the positive and negative aspects of technology in dating. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing dating apps to the importance of physical interaction, which affects the overall flow, leading to a coherence score of 3."
