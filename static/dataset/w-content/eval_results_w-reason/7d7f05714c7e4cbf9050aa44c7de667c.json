        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed for voting and community engagement, which are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence is strong, with a clear structure and logical progression from one point to the next, maintaining a consistent style throughout. However, the ideas do not introduce significantly new insights beyond the introduction, which limits the idea score."
