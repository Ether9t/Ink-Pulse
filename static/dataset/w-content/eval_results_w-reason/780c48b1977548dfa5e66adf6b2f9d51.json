        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard critique of screen time, emphasizing the loss of meaningful human interaction and the potential for digital toxicity. While these ideas are not particularly novel, they are developed with some depth, such as the discussion on the nuances of face-to-face communication and the potential for a 'digitally transmitted' pandemic. Thus, it earns a 3 for idea score. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from the impact of screens on personal relationships to broader societal implications. The transitions are smooth, and the style is consistent throughout."
