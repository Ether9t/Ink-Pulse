        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of audiobooks and the ability to multitask while listening. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these common points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It maintains a logical flow from discussing the benefits of audiobooks to personal preferences and examples, such as the Harry Potter audiobooks, which enhances the narrative without abrupt shifts."
