        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of bees being able to communicate and follow orders, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of bees building a honey farm and then a palace is imaginative and adds depth to the narrative. The twist of the bees seeking freedom and ultimately rebelling against the protagonist adds an unexpected and original angle, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the initial command to the bees' rebellion. The transitions between the protagonist's demands and the bees' responses are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone throughout, justifying a coherence score of 4."
