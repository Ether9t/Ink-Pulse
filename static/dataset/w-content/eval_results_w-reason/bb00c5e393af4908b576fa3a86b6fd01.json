        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the inevitability of increased screen time and the benefits of digital transformation accelerated by the pandemic. These ideas are not particularly novel but are developed with examples like remote work efficiency and digital communication with family. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that progresses logically from the inevitability of digital transformation to specific examples and a conclusion. The article maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, with clear transitions between points."
