        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the historical context of voting rights and the evolution of news accessibility, which are not entirely novel but are well-articulated. The argument that informed voting can decrease suffering is a logical extension of the introduction but not a groundbreaking insight. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from historical context to the moral implications of staying informed. Transitions are smooth, and the article is stylistically consistent."
