        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative of humans rediscovering and harnessing an old power to fight against an alien threat, which is a common trope in science fiction. The idea of forming alliances and the moral dilemma faced by the elder adds some depth, but it doesn't significantly expand beyond typical genre conventions, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, with a clear progression from the elder's capture to Nia's leadership and the eventual defeat of the aliens. However, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the elder's capture to Nia's rallying of the tribes, which affects the overall flow, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
