        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the instinct to protect the helpless and the comparison between humans and animals. However, it lacks deep exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing human empathy to the animal rights movement without a clear connection. Overall, the article is coherent but could benefit from more structured progression and deeper exploration of new ideas."
