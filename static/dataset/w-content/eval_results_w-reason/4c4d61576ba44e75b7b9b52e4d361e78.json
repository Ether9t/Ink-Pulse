        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is a creative and humorous idea. The interaction between the pig and the wolf, involving a misunderstanding with a depleted uranium 'bikkie,' adds further originality. Therefore, the idea score is 4 for its clear new insights and novel angles. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the wolf's attempt to enter the house to the humorous conclusion. The dialogue and actions flow naturally, though there are minor moments of abruptness, such as the wolf's sudden departure. Overall, the coherence score is 4 for its well-structured narrative with mostly smooth transitions."
