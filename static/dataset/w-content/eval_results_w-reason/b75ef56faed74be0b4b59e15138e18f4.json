        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of period products to school supplies like pencils and the argument that parents should be responsible for providing these items. However, it lacks novel insights or creative expansion beyond the introduction. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and clear argumentation, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing school responsibilities to the cost of period products. Overall, the article is coherent but not exceptionally seamless."
