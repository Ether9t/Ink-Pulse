        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of technology on dating, such as the potential for dishonesty and unrealistic self-presentation. These are common critiques of online dating, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The article is well-structured and maintains a logical flow, discussing the negative aspects of technology in dating consistently throughout, which justifies a coherence score of 4. The transitions between points are smooth, and the argument is presented clearly, though it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights."
