        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other hygiene products like toilet paper and soap, and suggesting an anonymous vote by female students. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights into the topic. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the stigma of buying tampons to proposing a voting system. Overall, the article is coherent but could benefit from more refined transitions and deeper exploration of ideas."
