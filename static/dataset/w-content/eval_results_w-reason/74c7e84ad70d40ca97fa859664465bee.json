        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the dual nature of social media as both a connector and a source of mental health issues. It suggests moderation and education on technology use, which are common recommendations. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing social media's impact to proposing educational strategies. The article could benefit from a more structured argument and smoother transitions between points."
