        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of the United States using its isolation to advance space travel and eventually colonize Mars, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This contributes a clear new insight into the narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden decision to move to Mars and the rapid transformation of Mars into a habitable planet, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
