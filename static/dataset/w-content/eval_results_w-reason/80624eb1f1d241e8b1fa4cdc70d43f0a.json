        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that schools should provide pads and tampons as needed, similar to other personal products like toilet paper and soap. It develops this idea by comparing the provision of these items to other supplies that are not provided for home use, which is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression, with smooth transitions between points. The argument is consistently developed, though it could benefit from deeper exploration of the nuances of period poverty and the unique needs of menstruating students."
