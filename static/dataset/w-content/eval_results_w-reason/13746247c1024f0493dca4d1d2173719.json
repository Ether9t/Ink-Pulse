        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the connection between period poverty and broader social issues like misogyny and LGBTQ rights. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond the introduction. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that logically progresses from the problem of period shaming to the broader implications of not addressing it in schools. The article maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, contributing to its overall clarity and readability."
