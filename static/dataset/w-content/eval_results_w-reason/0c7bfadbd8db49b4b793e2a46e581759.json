        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on the concept of immortality and societal division, expanding beyond the introduction by exploring the development of new technologies and societal structures by the 'Lost Generations.' The idea of the Lost creating a superior drug and the unexpected consequences of its use on the Lucky Ones adds depth and originality, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the Lucky Ones' suffering to their disappearance, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
