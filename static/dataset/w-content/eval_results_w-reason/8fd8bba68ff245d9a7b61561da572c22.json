        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, focusing on discipline and creativity as important lessons from school. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated and supported with personal anecdotes, which adds some depth. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It transitions smoothly from discussing discipline to creativity and ties both concepts together effectively in the conclusion. However, the ideas themselves are not groundbreaking, which is why the idea score is moderate."
