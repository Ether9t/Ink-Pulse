        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a young protagonist discovering latent powers, which is a common trope in fantasy and science fiction. However, it does develop the concept by introducing the societal context of a post-alien invasion world where mana is reawakening, which adds some depth. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea. The coherence is strong, with a clear narrative progression from John's school life to the discovery of his powers and the subsequent opportunity to go to the capital. The transitions are smooth, and the style is consistent, earning it a coherence score of 4."
