        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development about the benefits of audiobooks, such as multitasking, accessibility for those who struggle with reading, and convenience. However, it lacks deep or original insights beyond these common points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent but has occasional unevenness, such as abrupt shifts in focus from personal experiences to general benefits and back, which affects the flow. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
