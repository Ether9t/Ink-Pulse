        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of dating apps in reducing nerves and allowing upfront communication about intentions. These are not particularly novel but are well-explained. The coherence is strong, with a clear structure and logical progression from discussing personal experiences to general observations about dating apps. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
