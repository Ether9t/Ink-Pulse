        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a shallow exploration of the topic, primarily focusing on the author's personal opinion that stereotypes are not offensive and should be accepted as part of entertainment. This perspective lacks depth and fails to engage with the complexities of how stereotypes can perpetuate harmful biases, thus earning a score of 2 for new ideas. The coherence score is 3, as the article maintains a generally consistent tone and logical structure, but it occasionally lacks smooth transitions, particularly when shifting from discussing stereotypes in general to specific examples like 'The Hangover' and 'The Big Bang Theory.'"
