        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development regarding the stereotype of the hapless father figure in sitcoms. It discusses the origins and persistence of this trope, suggesting it may stem from wish fulfillment or audience biases. However, it doesn't offer particularly novel insights or solutions, which limits the idea score to a 3. The coherence score is a 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts, maintaining a logical flow from the introduction of the stereotype to its critique and the call for its retirement."
