        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of audiobooks for multitasking and their benefits for people with dyslexia. It also touches on the limitations of audiobooks for subjects requiring visual aids. However, these insights are not particularly novel, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from discussing personal preferences to the broader implications and limitations of audiobooks. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
