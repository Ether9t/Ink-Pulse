        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the negative impact of stereotypes in media, particularly those based on race, gender, and sexuality. It discusses personal experiences and the broader societal implications of such portrayals, which are common discussions in this context. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea development as it doesn't introduce novel insights but does provide some development beyond the introduction. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional awkward transitions and some repetition, such as the repeated emphasis on personal experience and the general harm of stereotypes, which slightly disrupts the flow. Thus, it also scores a 3 for coherence."
