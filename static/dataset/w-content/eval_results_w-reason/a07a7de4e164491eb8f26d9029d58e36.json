        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative impacts of excessive screen time, such as effects on eye health, sleep, and mental health. These are common concerns and do not offer new insights beyond what is already widely discussed. The suggestion to limit screen time for entertainment and engage in outdoor activities or reading is also a standard recommendation. Therefore, the idea score is 3. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, discussing the negative impacts first and then suggesting solutions. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing health impacts to the current state of COVID-19 cases, which affects the flow. Thus, the coherence score is 3."
