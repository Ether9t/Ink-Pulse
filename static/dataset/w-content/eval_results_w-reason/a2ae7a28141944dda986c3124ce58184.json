        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of screen time in discovering new activities and providing distractions from unhealthy habits. These points are not particularly novel but are relevant and expanded upon. The coherence of the article is strong, with a well-structured argument that progresses logically from the necessity of screen time during the pandemic to its potential benefits. Transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
