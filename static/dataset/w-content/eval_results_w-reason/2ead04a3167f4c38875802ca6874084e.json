        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development about the benefits of dating apps, such as efficiency, safety, and the ability to meet a wide range of people. These points are not particularly novel but are well-articulated, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of thoughts, discussing various aspects of dating apps in a consistent manner. However, it lacks a deeper exploration of potential downsides or alternative perspectives, which could have enhanced both the idea and coherence scores."
