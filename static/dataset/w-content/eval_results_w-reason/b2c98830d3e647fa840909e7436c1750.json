        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights by framing college sports as a business where athletes are the product, which is a novel angle beyond the introduction. It argues that athletes should be compensated as they are integral to the revenue generation of colleges, which is a fresh perspective. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that logically progresses from the NCAA's role as a business to the financial benefits colleges receive from sports. However, there are minor areas where the argument could be more tightly connected, preventing a perfect score."
