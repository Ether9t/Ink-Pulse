        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights by emphasizing the importance of teaching life skills such as financial management and computer literacy, which are often overlooked in favor of standardized testing. It also introduces the novel idea of mandatory volunteer work for high school students to foster compassion and understanding. These ideas go beyond the introduction's general question about important school learnings. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from identifying the problem to suggesting solutions. However, there are minor transitions that could be smoother, such as the shift from discussing life skills to the impact of social media."
