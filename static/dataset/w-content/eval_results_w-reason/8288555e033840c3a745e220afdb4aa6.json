        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the connection to oral traditions and the convenience of multitasking with audiobooks. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas, moving from historical context to personal preference and practical benefits, which supports a coherence score of 4. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
