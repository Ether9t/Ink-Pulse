        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the impact of period shaming on self-esteem and education, and the comparison of pads and tampons to other hygienic items provided by schools. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep exploration beyond these points, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It logically discusses the negative effects of period shaming, the necessity of providing free pads and tampons, and the importance of privacy and education, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout."
