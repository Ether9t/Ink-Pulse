        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative effects of excessive screen time, such as sleep disruption and eye strain. These are common concerns and do not offer new insights beyond the introduction, hence the idea score of 3. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of ideas. It logically discusses the health impacts of screen time and maintains a consistent tone throughout, though it lacks deeper exploration or novel perspectives."
