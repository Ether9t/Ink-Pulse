        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the emotional and societal impact of the immortality drug's side effects on both the 'Lost Generations' and the youthful population. The interaction between the protagonist and the young adults introduces a fresh perspective on regret and empathy, which adds depth beyond the introduction. The idea of the 'Lost Generations' being 'lucky' due to their exclusion from the drug is a strong original concept. Coherence is well-maintained with a clear narrative progression from the protagonist's confusion to the revelation of the side effects. The emotional transitions are smooth, and the stylistic consistency is upheld throughout the article, though there is a slight abruptness in the shift from the personal interaction to the reading of the poster."
