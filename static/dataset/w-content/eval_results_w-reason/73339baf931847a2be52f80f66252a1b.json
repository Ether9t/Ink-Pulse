        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat novel angle by suggesting that one can appear informed without actually engaging with the news, which is a standard idea with some development. However, it doesn't delve deeply into the implications or consequences of this approach, limiting its originality. The coherence is generally maintained, with a clear structure and logical progression from the problem of news-induced hopelessness to the proposed solution of feigning knowledge. However, the tone shifts from a serious discussion to a more satirical suggestion of running for office, which may feel uneven to some readers."
