        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on the consequences of immortality, focusing on societal and economic impacts rather than personal or ethical dilemmas. The idea that people lose interest in work and the subsequent societal breakdown is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The government's attempts to solve the problem and the unintended consequences add depth to the narrative. However, the resolution of giving the antidote to everyone and the return to 'normal' could have been explored more deeply. Coherence is strong, with a logical progression from the discovery of the side effect to the government's response and eventual resolution. The transitions between sections are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
