        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other essential items provided in schools and addressing period poverty. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep expansion beyond the introduction. The coherence is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. The argument is logically developed, and the transitions between points are smooth, maintaining a consistent style throughout."
