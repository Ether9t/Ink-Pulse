        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative impacts of excessive screen time, such as impaired sleep, lack of physical activity, and reduced social interaction. These are well-known concerns, but the article does provide personal experience and some elaboration, which adds a bit of depth, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from one point to the next. The transitions between the points about sleep, physical activity, and social interaction are smooth, and the overall argument is consistent, justifying a score of 4 for coherence."
