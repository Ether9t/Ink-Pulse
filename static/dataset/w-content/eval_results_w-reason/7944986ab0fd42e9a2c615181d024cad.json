        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that the perception of risk in sports is subjective and varies from person to person. It also touches on the idea that parents have the right to decide what is too dangerous for their children, which adds a slight new angle. However, it doesn't delve deeply into novel insights or original thinking beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It starts with personal opinions, moves to broader societal views, and concludes with a parental perspective, all while maintaining a consistent tone and style."
