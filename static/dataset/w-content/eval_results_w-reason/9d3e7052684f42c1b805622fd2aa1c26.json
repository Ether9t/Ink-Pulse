        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed and the potential harm of misinformation. It touches on the biases in media and the need for skepticism, which are common discussions in media literacy. However, it lacks novel insights or particularly original angles, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of ideas. It maintains a logical flow from discussing the responsibility of citizens to the biases in media, and finally to the importance of deeper understanding, though it could benefit from more seamless transitions between some sections."
