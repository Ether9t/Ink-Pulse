        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that focusing on animal welfare is justified due to animals' innocence and inability to help themselves, which is a common argument in animal welfare discussions. It does not introduce significantly new or original insights beyond this established perspective, hence the idea score of 3. However, the article is well-structured and maintains a logical flow, with clear reasoning and transitions between points, such as the moral obligation to help the innocent and the false dichotomy argument, which justifies the coherence score of 4."
