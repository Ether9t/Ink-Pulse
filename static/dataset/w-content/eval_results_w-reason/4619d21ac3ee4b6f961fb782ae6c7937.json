        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development beyond the introduction. It introduces the concept of humans glowing blue due to mana usage and the varying mana regeneration times based on health and activity levels, which adds some depth to the initial premise. However, these ideas are not deeply explored or particularly novel. The narrative of discovering powers and fighting back against the Tyrants is a common trope in fantasy and science fiction. The coherence score is 3 because the article is generally coherent, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing mana to the personal story of the protagonist and Harry. The narrative flow is mostly logical, but the emotional transition from the battle to the protagonist's resolve to avenge Harry could be smoother."
