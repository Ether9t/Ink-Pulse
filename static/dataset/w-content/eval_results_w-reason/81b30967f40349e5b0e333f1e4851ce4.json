        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of the US forming a new alliance after discovering the deception, which is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel. The concept of the 'Allied Nations' and the dynamics of post-isolation alliances are developed but lack depth or unique insights, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the aftermath of the isolation and the formation of new alliances. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt mention of the US becoming a world power again without much elaboration on how it achieved this during isolation. This results in a coherence score of 3."
