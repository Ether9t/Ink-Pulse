        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by exploring the protagonist's reflections on their past lives and the anticipation of their new life. It introduces the novel idea of watching one's future life as a movie, which adds depth to the reincarnation concept. However, the exploration of these ideas remains somewhat standard, focusing on familiar themes of past life diversity and the desire to retain memories. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured, with a clear progression from the protagonist's reflections to their rebirth. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
