        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard argument that pursuing extreme sports is selfish due to the risks involved, which is a common perspective. It does not introduce significantly new or original ideas beyond the introduction, but it does expand on the emotional impact on loved ones and the potential risk to others involved in the sport. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the risks and emotional consequences, but it occasionally lacks smooth transitions, such as the abrupt mention of government discouragement without much context. Thus, it scores a 3 for coherence."
