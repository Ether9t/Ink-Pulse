        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a person trying to reconnect with family members who have become emotionally distant due to a drug. The concept of attempting to teach them humanity is somewhat developed but lacks depth or novel insights, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is generally maintained, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden decision to erect a tomb and leave, which affects the flow. Thus, the coherence score is also a 3."
