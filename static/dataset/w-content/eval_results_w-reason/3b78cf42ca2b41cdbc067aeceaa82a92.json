        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to other necessities like toilet paper and soap, and the mention of period poverty. However, it lacks new insights or novel angles beyond what is commonly discussed in this context. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and progression from the necessity of pads and tampons to the issue of period poverty and government actions. However, the article could benefit from smoother transitions and more stylistic consistency, as it occasionally feels repetitive and lacks depth in its argumentation."
