        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as balancing screen time with real-life interactions and using screens for work and education while avoiding unnecessary use. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing screen use in work to social media. The article could benefit from a more structured progression and clearer transitions between points."
