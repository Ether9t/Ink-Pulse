        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, focusing on communication, math, and science as the most important things students should learn in school. These are common subjects typically emphasized in educational discussions, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. However, the article does provide some personal insights, such as the author's experience with a math teacher, which adds a bit of depth. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from one point to the next. Each section logically follows the previous one, and the transitions between topics are smooth, maintaining a consistent style throughout."
