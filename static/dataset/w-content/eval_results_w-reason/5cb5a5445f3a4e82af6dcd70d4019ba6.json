        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that parents should be responsible for providing period products and the comparison of tampons to deodorant. However, it lacks novel insights or creative expansion beyond the introduction. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing parental responsibility to the potential need for custom products due to allergies. Overall, the article is coherent but not exceptionally well-structured."
