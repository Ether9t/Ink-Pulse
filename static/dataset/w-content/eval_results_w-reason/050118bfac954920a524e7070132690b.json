        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard development of the shapeshifter concept introduced in the introduction. The idea of the shapeshifter causing the woman to be admitted to the ER is a logical extension of the premise, but it doesn't introduce any particularly novel insights or creative expansions beyond the initial setup. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following the sequence of events from the woman's discovery to the shapeshifter's decision to leave. However, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden decision of the shapeshifter to walk away, which could have been more smoothly integrated. This results in a coherence score of 3."
