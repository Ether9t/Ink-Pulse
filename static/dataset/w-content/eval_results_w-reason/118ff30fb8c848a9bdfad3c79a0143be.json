        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to first aid items and the emphasis on the immediate need for these products. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep insights beyond the introduction. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that progresses logically from the personal experience of inconvenience to the broader implications for students, maintaining a clear and natural flow throughout."
