        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that avoiding news can bring calm and relief, and the critique of news media's role in societal division. These are not particularly novel but are developed with personal reflections. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from discussing personal experiences to broader societal observations. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from personal feelings about the news to a broader societal critique, which affects the overall flow."
