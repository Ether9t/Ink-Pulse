        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by suggesting that the obligation to keep up with the news is context-dependent, based on one's role or personal circumstances. This is a novel angle beyond the introduction, which only questions the general responsibility of staying informed. The article provides specific examples for different roles, such as CEOs, doctors, and ordinary citizens, which adds depth to the argument. However, it could have explored more diverse perspectives or counterarguments to achieve a higher score. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression from discussing professional obligations to personal ones. The transitions between different roles and responsibilities are smooth, and the style is consistent throughout. There is a clear conclusion that ties back to the main argument, reinforcing the idea of 'enlightened self-interest.'"
