        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and imaginative scenario where Barack Obama, in his retirement, is called upon by historical figures to engage in a supernatural mission. This concept is quite original, especially with the inclusion of spirits like Jackie O, Malcolm X, and others, which adds a unique twist to the narrative, earning it a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article maintains a generally logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the phone call to being in spirit form and the quick introduction of multiple historical figures without much context or development. This creates occasional unevenness in the narrative flow."
