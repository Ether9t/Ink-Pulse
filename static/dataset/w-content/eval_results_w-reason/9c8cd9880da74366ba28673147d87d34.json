        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it explores the reawakening of Mana and its implications for the survivors. The concept of glowing as a manifestation of Mana and the subsequent realization of invincibility are logical extensions of the introduction, but they do not introduce highly original ideas beyond the initial premise. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. The narrative flows smoothly from the discovery of glowing to the realization of its significance, with clear transitions between the stages of understanding and action."
