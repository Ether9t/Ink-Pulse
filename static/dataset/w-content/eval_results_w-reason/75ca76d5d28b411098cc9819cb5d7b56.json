        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that keeping up with the news is a personal choice and that news can be biased and sensationalized. These are not particularly novel insights but are developed with some depth. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural transitions throughout. It consistently argues that staying informed is a personal choice and supports this with reasons like the potential negative impact on mental health and the unreliability of news sources."
