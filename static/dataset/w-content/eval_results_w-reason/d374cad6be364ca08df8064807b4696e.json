        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the need for more research and the importance of informing athletes about risks. However, it lacks depth and originality, as these are common discussions in the context of sports safety. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several awkward transitions and lacks a clear structure. For instance, it jumps from discussing the dangers of sports to the need for research without a smooth transition, and the argument about minors playing sports is not well integrated into the overall narrative."
