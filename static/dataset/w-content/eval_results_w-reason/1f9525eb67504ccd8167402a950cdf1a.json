        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article primarily discusses the emotional aspects of isolation, such as loneliness and fear of abandonment, which are common themes and do not offer much new or original thinking beyond the introduction. Therefore, it scores a 2 for new ideas due to its shallow exploration of these themes. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally consistent tone and logical structure, discussing various aspects of loneliness and coping mechanisms. However, it lacks a strong narrative progression and occasionally feels repetitive, which results in a coherence score of 3."
