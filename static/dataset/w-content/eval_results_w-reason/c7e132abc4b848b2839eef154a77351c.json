These points are not particularly novel but are well-developed and relevant to the topic. Therefore, the idea score is 3. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency throughout, with smooth transitions between the different benefits of screen time."
