        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that the reasonableness of a sport is subjective and depends on an individual's willingness to accept risks. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond this perspective. The coherence of the article is strong, with a well-structured argument that logically progresses from the acceptance of risks in sports to the subjective nature of what is considered reasonable. Transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
