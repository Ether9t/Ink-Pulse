        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a secret society controlling the world, which is a common conspiracy theory. However, it adds a novel twist by involving past presidents and the transformation into lizard people, which gives it some originality, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several abrupt transitions, such as moving from the economy crash to turning citizens into lizards, which disrupts the flow. The narrative lacks smooth progression and feels disjointed in parts."
