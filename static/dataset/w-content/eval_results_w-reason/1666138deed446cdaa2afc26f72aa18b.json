        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that pursuing extreme sports is aligned with the human spirit and personal growth. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond the introduction. The argument that extreme sports are a personal choice and not selfish is a common perspective. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It smoothly transitions from discussing the human spirit to personal growth and the acceptance of risk, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
