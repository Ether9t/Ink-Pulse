        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other essential products like toilet paper and soap, and discussing the gender disparity in access to these products. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights into the topic, such as potential solutions or examples from other countries. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing school provisions to broader societal issues and the hypothetical scenario of men having periods. Overall, the article is coherent but could benefit from more structured argumentation and exploration of new ideas."
