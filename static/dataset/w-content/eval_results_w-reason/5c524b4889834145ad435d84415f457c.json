        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents fragmented and shallow ideas beyond the introduction. It touches on survival strategies and regrets about not taking the drug, but these ideas are not deeply explored or developed. The article lacks new insights or novel angles, resulting in a low idea score. In terms of coherence, the article is mostly smooth but has several awkward transitions. The narrative jumps between personal reflections, hypothetical scenarios, and societal critiques without clear transitions, leading to a disjointed reading experience. Overall, the article lacks depth and structural refinement."
