        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it explores the protagonist's journey of discovering he is a father and the subsequent emotional and relational developments. The narrative follows a predictable path of initial shock, investigation, and eventual bonding with the daughter, which is a common trope in stories about unexpected parenthood. However, it does provide some development in the protagonist's emotional journey and the relationship-building process with his daughter. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the protagonist's discovery to meeting his daughter and starting to build a relationship. The transitions between the protagonist's thoughts, actions, and interactions with Soeurette and Harper are smooth, contributing to a well-structured narrative."
