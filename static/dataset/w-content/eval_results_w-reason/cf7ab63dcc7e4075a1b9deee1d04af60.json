        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on a family surprise involving Barack Obama, his daughter Malia, and her boyfriend Matt. The twist of Malia's pregnancy and the dinner celebration adds a layer of novelty, but the overall concept remains within expected boundaries for a family narrative. Thus, it earns a 3 for idea score. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the initial prank call to the dinner revelation. The transitions between events are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, warranting a coherence score of 4."
