        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the reflection on past lives and the choice of future lives, which are common themes in discussions about reincarnation. The personal aspiration to be a firefighter adds a personal touch but doesn't significantly expand on the introduction's premise. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from watching past and future lives to making a choice for the next life, and finally, the personal reflection on the desire to be a hero. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone throughout."
