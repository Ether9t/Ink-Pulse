        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of using wealth in a new life to help people from past lives, which is a logical extension of the reincarnation concept but not particularly novel. The idea of using previous selves to deliver money is somewhat creative, but not deeply explored. Coherence is generally maintained, but the transition from the protagonist's realization to the execution of the plan is somewhat abrupt. The article could benefit from more detailed exploration of the philosophical implications or emotional depth of interacting with past selves."
