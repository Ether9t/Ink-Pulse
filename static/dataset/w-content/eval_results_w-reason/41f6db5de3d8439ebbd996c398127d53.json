        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development by introducing the concept of using the same drug to eliminate the horde, which is a logical extension of the problem introduced. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep expansion beyond the introduction. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the military's failure to the protagonist's plan. The article could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed exploration of the protagonist's plan and its execution."
