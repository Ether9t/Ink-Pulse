        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the mental stress caused by news consumption and the sensationalism of news coverage. These are not particularly novel but are developed with examples like the plane crash scenario. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas, moving from the impact of news on mental health to the broader implications of not following the news. The transitions between points are smooth, contributing to a coherent argument."
