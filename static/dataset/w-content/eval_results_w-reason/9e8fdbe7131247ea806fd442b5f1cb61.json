        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of screen time, such as the comparison to addiction and the negative effects on social intelligence. However, it lacks deep or novel insights beyond these common observations, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, discussing personal experiences and broader implications, but it occasionally feels uneven, particularly in transitions between personal anecdotes and general statements. This results in a coherence score of 3."
