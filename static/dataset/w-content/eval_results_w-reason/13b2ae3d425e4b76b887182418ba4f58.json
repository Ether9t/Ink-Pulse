        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed to make educated decisions and the role of social media in spreading awareness. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond these points, which is why it scores a 3 for New Idea. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency throughout, earning it a score of 4 for Coherence."
