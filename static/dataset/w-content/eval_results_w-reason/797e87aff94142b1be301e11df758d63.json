        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a shallow and fragmented idea of Obama being involved in a mysterious task at Mar-a-Lago, which is not deeply explored or expanded upon beyond the initial setup. The interaction with Trump is abrupt and lacks depth, contributing to a low idea score. Coherence is also low due to the abrupt and jarring transition from the introduction to the main content, with a sudden and unexplained confrontation between Obama and Trump. The narrative lacks logical progression and stylistic consistency, resulting in a disjointed reading experience."
