        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the responsibility of citizens to stay informed and the impact of being informed on decision-making and community engagement. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep expansion beyond the introduction. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency, with smooth transitions between points, such as the discussion of social media's role in staying informed and the importance of understanding political events."
