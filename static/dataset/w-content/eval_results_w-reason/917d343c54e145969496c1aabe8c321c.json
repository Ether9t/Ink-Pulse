        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights, particularly in advocating for life skills and mental health education over traditional subjects, which is a novel angle. The suggestion of teaching nutrition as a form of medicine is also an original idea. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing life skills to personal experiences with ADHD. The article could benefit from smoother transitions between these sections."
