        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by challenging McDavis' argument with the perspective that the current system is already unfair and that inequality is inherent to college sports. This adds a novel angle to the debate about paying college athletes, thus earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 4, as the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. The argument is well-developed, with a clear critique of McDavis' points and a consistent style throughout. However, it could be slightly more refined in transitions between points, which prevents it from achieving a perfect score."
