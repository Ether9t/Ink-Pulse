        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the balance between the risks of excessive screen time and the benefits of staying connected during the pandemic. It highlights personal anecdotes, like using an iPad to stay in touch with family, which adds a personal touch but doesn't introduce highly original concepts. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from discussing potential negative effects to emphasizing the importance of digital connection. The personal story is integrated smoothly, contributing to a coherent narrative, thus earning a score of 4."
