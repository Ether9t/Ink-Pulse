        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the provision of free pads and tampons in schools. It discusses the inadequacy of current options, the necessity of providing both pads and tampons, and the potential embarrassment and inconvenience faced by students. However, it doesn't introduce significantly new or original ideas beyond the introduction. The suggestion of using tokens for access to machines is a somewhat novel angle, but not deeply explored. The coherence score is higher as the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from discussing personal experiences to broader implications and potential solutions, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
