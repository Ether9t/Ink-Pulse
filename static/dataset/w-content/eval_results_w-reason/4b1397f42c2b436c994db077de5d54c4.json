        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development beyond the introduction. It expands on the geopolitical changes in the world, such as the formation of new nations and alliances, which is a logical extension of the introduction's premise. However, it lacks deep or creative expansion, as it primarily focuses on the US's search for allies and the new world order without introducing multiple strong original ideas. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It smoothly transitions from describing the geopolitical landscape to the US's strategic decisions, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
