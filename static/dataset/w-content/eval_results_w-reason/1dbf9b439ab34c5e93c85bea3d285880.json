        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the wolf's perspective and his realization that he needs a new approach after failing with the previous pigs. This adds depth and originality beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The wolf's plan to use his talent for disguise and role play, inspired by seeing Little Red Riding Hood, is a creative twist. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression as it follows the wolf's thought process and decision-making. The transition from the wolf's reflection on past failures to his new plan is smooth, though the abrupt introduction of Little Red Riding Hood could be slightly jarring for some readers. Overall, the article is well-structured and stylistically consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
