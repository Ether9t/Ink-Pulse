        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the theme of finding value in love and community over fame and wealth. This is a common narrative, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. However, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from initial disappointment to eventual fulfillment through family and community, earning a coherence score of 4. The transitions between life events and the overarching lesson are smooth, contributing to a cohesive narrative."
