        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the consideration of age, personal circumstances, and societal norms in evaluating the risk of extreme sports. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure, with clear transitions between points about age, societal perception, and individual choice. The argument is consistent and flows naturally, though it doesn't delve deeply into any new insights."
