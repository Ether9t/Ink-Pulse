        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative of a woman repeatedly dating a shapeshifter without realizing it, which is a somewhat novel concept but not deeply explored beyond the introduction. The idea of the shapeshifter losing his abilities and being revealed as a man with a Napoleon complex adds a slight twist, but it is not fully developed or explored in depth. Therefore, the idea score is a 3. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, following the woman's journey through relationships, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from her heartbreak to meeting a new man. The ending also feels rushed, with the shapeshifter's fate quickly summarized. Thus, the coherence score is also a 3."
