        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that the experiences and social dynamics in school do not define one's future, which is a common realization among many. However, it does develop this idea by sharing a personal narrative about overcoming bullying and starting anew after graduation, which adds some depth. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured, with a clear progression from personal experience to broader insights. The transitions between paragraphs are smooth, and the narrative is consistent, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
