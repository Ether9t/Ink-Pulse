        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of the United States feeling betrayed and attempting to negotiate with the Coalition, which is a logical extension of the introduction but lacks significant originality or depth, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. The narrative of the Coalition's collapse due to internal conflicts and the U.S. regaining its superpower status is predictable and not particularly novel. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, but the transition from the U.S. feeling panic to negotiating an agreement, and then the sudden collapse of the Coalition, feels somewhat abrupt and lacks detailed explanation, leading to a coherence score of 3."
