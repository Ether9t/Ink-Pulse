        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and employs advanced technology to outsmart the wolf. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of a laser gun and grenade launcher without much context or buildup. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed explanations of the wolf's plans and the pig's defenses."
