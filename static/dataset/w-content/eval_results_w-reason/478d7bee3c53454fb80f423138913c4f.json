        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding stereotypical characters in media. It critiques the common tropes of the 'perfect' woman and man in romance stories, which is a familiar argument, but it does offer a personal perspective on wanting more realistic portrayals. The call for stories that reflect real people and relationships adds some depth, but it doesn't introduce highly original concepts. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from identifying the problem to suggesting a solution. The transitions are smooth, and the style is consistent throughout."
