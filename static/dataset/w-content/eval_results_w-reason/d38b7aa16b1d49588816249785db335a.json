        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article provides a personal narrative to support the argument that extreme mountain climbing is too dangerous to be considered a sport. This personal angle adds depth to the discussion, but the ideas presented are fairly standard and align with common arguments against extreme sports, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from personal experience to broader conclusions about the nature of extreme sports. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative is consistent, though it could benefit from more varied perspectives or counterarguments to enhance depth."
