        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to other essential products provided in schools and the call for government budget reallocation. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of arguments. It maintains a logical flow from discussing the naturalness of periods to government responsibility, education, and freedom of choice, with smooth transitions between these points."
