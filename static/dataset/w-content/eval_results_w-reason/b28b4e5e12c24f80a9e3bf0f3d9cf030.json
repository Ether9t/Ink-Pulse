        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the 'dumb blonde' stereotype, emphasizing the importance of recognizing different forms of intelligence. It doesn't introduce highly original concepts but does expand on the idea that intelligence is multifaceted. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, moving from the stereotype's description to its implications and concluding with a personal stance against supporting such portrayals. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed."
