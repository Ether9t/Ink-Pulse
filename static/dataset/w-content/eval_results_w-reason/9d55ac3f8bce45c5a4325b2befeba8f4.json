        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the introduction with the concept of JFK being alive and leading a secret task force against alien hybrids. This is a creative and original angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is well-maintained throughout the article, with a logical progression from Obama's skepticism to his acceptance of the mission. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4. However, the article could have been more detailed in describing the task force's operations or the nature of the alien threat to achieve a perfect score."
