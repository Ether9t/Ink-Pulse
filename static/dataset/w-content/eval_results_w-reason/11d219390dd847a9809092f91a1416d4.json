        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of controlling one's reincarnation through a cinematic experience, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of making life choices through a 'choose your own adventure' style is a fresh take on the reincarnation theme, earning it a score of 4 for new ideas. The article is well-structured, with a logical progression from making career changes to winning the lottery and then using wealth for philanthropy. The transitions between these life stages are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, justifying a coherence score of 4."
