        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is an original and creative idea. The concept of a wolf rental service and the pig selling the land adds further originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is strong, with a logical progression from the wolf's curiosity to the pig's clever trap and eventual departure. The narrative flows well, though the transition to the wolf rental service could have been smoother, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
