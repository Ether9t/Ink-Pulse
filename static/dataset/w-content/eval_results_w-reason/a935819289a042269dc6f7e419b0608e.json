        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of Barack Obama being abducted by aliens who give him a unique statue made of an unknown metal, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This concept of extraterrestrial beings providing a gift to humanity for technological advancement is an original angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from Obama's abduction to his waking up and visiting the White House. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions between these events."
