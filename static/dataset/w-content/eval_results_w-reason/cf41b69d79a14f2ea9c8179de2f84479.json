        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development beyond the introduction. It explores the United States' approach to immigration and trade after isolation, which is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel. The idea of selecting skilled immigrants and sharing technology is somewhat standard in speculative scenarios. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It transitions smoothly from discussing the initial challenges to the implementation of President Young's plan and its outcomes, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
