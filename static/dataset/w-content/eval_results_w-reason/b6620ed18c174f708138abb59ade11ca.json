        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard critique of the over-saturation of violent superhero movies, particularly focusing on the character of Deadpool. It discusses the potential desensitization to violence and loss of empathy, which are common arguments in media criticism. Therefore, the idea score is 3, as it offers some development but lacks novel insights. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the impact of violent media on society and children. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing Deadpool to broader societal impacts, which affects the coherence score, resulting in a 3."
