        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the introduction of the 'Retirement Zone' and the 'Death Game' as societal responses to the side effects of the immortality drug. However, these concepts are not deeply explored or particularly novel, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 2 because the article has a mostly smooth flow but includes awkward transitions, such as the abrupt introduction of the 'Death Game' without sufficient context or explanation. The article lacks a clear, natural progression and feels somewhat fragmented."
