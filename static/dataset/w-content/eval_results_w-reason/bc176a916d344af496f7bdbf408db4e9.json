        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of the side effects of an immortality drug leading to exponential growth in size, resulting in societal and logistical challenges. The concept of giants being categorized and relocated to Mars or beyond is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. However, the idea of giants living happily on Mars and Earth is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth, preventing a perfect score. Coherence is generally maintained, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the giants' challenges to their peaceful existence on Mars, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
