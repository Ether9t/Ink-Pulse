        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of staying informed for democratic participation and the potential impact of engaging with current events on social issues like climate change and refugee crises. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from one point to the next. It effectively ties the importance of staying informed to both personal and societal benefits, with smooth transitions between ideas."
