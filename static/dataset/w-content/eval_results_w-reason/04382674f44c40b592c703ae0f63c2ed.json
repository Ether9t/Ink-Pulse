        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of time travel to prevent a future catastrophe, which is a common trope in science fiction. However, it does develop the idea by introducing the concept of convincing a scientist to abandon his research, which adds some depth. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea. The coherence of the article is strong, with a clear narrative structure and logical progression from the protagonist's realization of the side effects to the confrontation with the scientist. The transitions are smooth, and the style is consistent, earning it a coherence score of 4."
