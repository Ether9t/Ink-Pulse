        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the aftermath of the US's isolation and the reactions of other nations. It doesn't introduce multiple strong original ideas beyond the introduction but does expand on the concept of the US being left behind. The coherence is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from the international leaders' conversation to the US President's realization and subsequent address to the nation. The transitions between these sections are smooth, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout."
