        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a 92nd pig and a wolf who desires a strong house for security and friendship, which is a fresh angle. The idea of the wolf trying to build a house as strong as the pig's and the concept of 92 pigs testing its strength adds originality. However, the article could delve deeper into the wolf's character development or the societal implications of his actions for a higher score. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are some awkward transitions, such as the sudden shift from the wolf's admiration to his attempt to build a house. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more consistent stylistic elements to enhance readability."
