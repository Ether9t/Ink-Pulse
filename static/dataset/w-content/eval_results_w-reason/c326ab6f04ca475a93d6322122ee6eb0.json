        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing the side effects and eventual consequences of the drug, which is a standard development of the initial premise. It introduces the idea of the drug causing unexpected deaths, which adds some depth but is not particularly novel given the setup. Thus, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, discussing the progression from mild symptoms to severe consequences. However, there are some awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing symptoms to deaths, which affects the flow. Therefore, it scores a 3 for coherence."
