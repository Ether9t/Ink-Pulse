        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of screen time, particularly focusing on the potential negative effects of excessive use, such as detachment from reality and difficulties in social interactions. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The article does not introduce multiple strong original ideas or deep expansion beyond the introduction, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of thoughts. It maintains a logical structure and stylistic consistency throughout, with smooth transitions between points, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
