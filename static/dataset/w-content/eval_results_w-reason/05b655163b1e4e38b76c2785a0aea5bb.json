        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development beyond the introduction. It explores the shapeshifter's background and his journey towards understanding love and relationships, which adds depth to the narrative. However, it doesn't introduce highly original concepts, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the shapeshifter's initial attempts to the eventual revelation of his true nature. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, justifying a score of 4 for coherence."
