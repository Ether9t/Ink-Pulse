        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of discipline, responsibility, and social skills learned in school. These are common themes but are developed with personal anecdotes, which adds some depth. However, the ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from personal experiences to broader advice for students. The transitions between sections are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone throughout."
