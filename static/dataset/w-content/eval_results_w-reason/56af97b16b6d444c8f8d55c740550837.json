        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a futuristic scenario where JFK contacts Obama from the future to warn about an alien invasion. This concept of time travel and extraterrestrial threats adds a creative twist beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article maintains a generally logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of COVID-19 as a bioweapon, which could have been more smoothly integrated into the narrative."
