        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the potential for corruption and resentment among students if college athletes were paid. It also raises questions about the role of colleges in sports and their tax-exempt status, which adds some depth to the discussion. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. The argument is well-organized, moving from the potential consequences of paying athletes to broader questions about the role of colleges, with smooth transitions between points."
