        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the introduction with the protagonist transforming into a bee and leading a rescue mission. This creative twist adds depth to the initial premise, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the narrative generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden transformation into a bee and the quick resolution of the conflict. Additionally, the ending introduces a twist with the protagonist being a wasp, which feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the story."
