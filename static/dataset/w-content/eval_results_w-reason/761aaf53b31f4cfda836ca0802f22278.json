        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea about the 'token black guy' stereotype, which is a well-known issue in media representation. It does offer some personal reflection on how this stereotype might influence real-life social dynamics, which adds some depth, but it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights or solutions. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, moving from personal observation to broader societal implications. However, the transitions between personal anecdotes and broader claims could be smoother, and the conclusion feels somewhat abrupt. Thus, it also scores a 3 for coherence."
