        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative of a young protagonist discovering his magical heritage and reuniting with his family, which is a common trope in fantasy literature. The idea of twins needing to reunite to unlock their full magical potential adds a slight twist, but it is not deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence of the article is strong, with a clear and logical progression from Riku's upbringing, his journey to Faltra, and the eventual reunion with his family. The transitions between sections are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, earning a coherence score of 4."
