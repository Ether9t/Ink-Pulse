        "reason": "The article presents fragmented and shallow ideas, primarily focusing on the lack of education and motivation in the U.S. during its isolation. It suggests that the U.S. should have prepared better by educating its population, but these ideas are not deeply developed or particularly novel. The coherence is mostly smooth but has several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the past to advising on future actions without a clear connection. The article lacks a strong logical structure and natural progression, making it feel somewhat disjointed."
