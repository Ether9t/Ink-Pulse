        "reason": "The article provides clear new insights into how dating apps have revolutionized dating by bringing more people into the dating world and facilitating new social connections, even friendships, which is a novel angle beyond the introduction. It discusses personal experiences and the broader social impact of dating apps, which adds depth to the topic. However, it could delve deeper into potential downsides or challenges. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured narrative that smoothly transitions from personal experiences to broader observations, maintaining a consistent tone and logical flow throughout."
