        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of dating apps in expanding the pool of potential partners and facilitating communication about relationship expectations. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from personal experiences to broader reflections on technology's impact on relationships. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
