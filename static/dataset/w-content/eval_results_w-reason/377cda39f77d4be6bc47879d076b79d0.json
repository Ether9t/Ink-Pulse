        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a post-apocalyptic world where magic resurfaces due to a reduced human population. The concept of 'chosen' and 'unchosen' adds a layer of societal structure, but it is not deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the reawakening of mana to the societal decision-making process. However, the transitions between ideas, such as the shift from magical abilities to societal rules, could be smoother, leading to a coherence score of 3."
