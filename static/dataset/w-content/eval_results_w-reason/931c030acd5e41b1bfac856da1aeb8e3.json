        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of JFK faking his death and working on a new planet, 'New Earth,' which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of time looping and the involvement of historical figures like Jackie Kennedy adds depth, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden mention of Michelle Obama already being on New Earth, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
