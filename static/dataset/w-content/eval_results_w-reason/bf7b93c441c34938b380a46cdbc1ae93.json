        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard argument against extreme sports, comparing them to historical practices like gladiator fights and duels, which adds some development beyond the introduction. However, it doesn't offer particularly novel insights or angles, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, moving from the dangers of extreme sports to the impact on families and society, and finally suggesting alternatives like esports. However, the transitions between these points are somewhat abrupt, and the comparison to historical practices feels slightly forced, leading to a coherence score of 3."
