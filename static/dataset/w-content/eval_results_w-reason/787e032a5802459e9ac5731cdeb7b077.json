        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the importance of independence, responsibility, and being a good person, which are common themes in discussions about education. These ideas are developed with some depth, such as explaining how independence allows for self-reliance and decision-making, and how responsibility leads to careful decision-making. However, the ideas are not particularly novel or original, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured, with a logical progression from independence to responsibility to being a good person. The transitions between these points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
