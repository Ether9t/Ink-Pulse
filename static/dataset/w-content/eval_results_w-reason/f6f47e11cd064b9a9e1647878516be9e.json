        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that human life should be prioritized over animal life, which is a common perspective. It introduces the notion that caring more for animals is a form of narcissism, which adds some development beyond the introduction, but this idea is not deeply explored or supported with evidence, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, but the transition from discussing empathy to labeling it as narcissism feels abrupt and lacks smooth progression, leading to a coherence score of 3."
