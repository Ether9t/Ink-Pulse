        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that college athletes should be paid, similar to other students who excel in their fields, which is a common argument in the debate. The suggestion of separating athletes into their own school is a somewhat novel angle, but it lacks depth and exploration of potential implications. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shift from discussing fairness to the idea of separating athletes into their own school, which could have been more smoothly integrated. Overall, the article provides a basic development of ideas with some coherence but lacks deeper exploration and seamless transitions."
