        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the ability to multitask and reduce paper waste, which are common arguments in favor of audiobooks. However, it does introduce a slightly less common angle by discussing the environmental impact of printed books. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing the benefits of audiobooks in a clear and organized manner. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article remains stylistically consistent throughout."
