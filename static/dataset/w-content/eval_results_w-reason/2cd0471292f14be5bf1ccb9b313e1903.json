        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it explores the woman's realization that she has been dating the same shapeshifter repeatedly. This is a logical extension of the introduction but doesn't introduce multiple strong original ideas or deep expansion beyond the initial premise. The coherence is generally maintained, with a clear narrative progression from the dinner scene to her internet search and eventual decision to join the foreign legion. However, the abrupt decision to join the foreign legion and never date again feels somewhat jarring and underdeveloped, affecting the overall coherence."
