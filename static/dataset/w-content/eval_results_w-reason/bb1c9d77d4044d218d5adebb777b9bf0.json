        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the responsibility of citizens to be informed and the impact of consumer choices on corporate behavior. These ideas are not particularly novel but are developed with examples like the environmental impact of companies. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from the importance of being informed to the consequences of ignorance, with smooth transitions between points."
