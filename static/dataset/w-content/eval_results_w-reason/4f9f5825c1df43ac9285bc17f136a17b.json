        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard critique of the overrepresentation of white male protagonists in media, which is a well-discussed topic. It does offer some development by referencing specific examples like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and American Idol, but it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from identifying the issue to suggesting a solution, maintaining a consistent tone throughout. This earns it a coherence score of 4."
