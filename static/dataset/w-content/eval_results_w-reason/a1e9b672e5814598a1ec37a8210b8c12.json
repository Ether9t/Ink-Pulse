        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a basic continuation of the introduction's premise, with the idea of humans developing laser powers and using them to confront aliens. However, it lacks depth and originality beyond the initial concept, resulting in a fragmented and shallow expansion of the idea. The coherence is also lacking, as the article jumps from the discovery of powers to building a spaceship and defeating aliens with minimal explanation or development. The transitions between these events are abrupt, and the narrative feels rushed and underdeveloped."
