        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other hygiene products provided in schools and suggesting the inclusion of menstruation education in sex ed classes. However, it lacks truly novel insights or creative angles, which is why it scores a 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is a 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency, with smooth transitions between points, although it could be more refined to achieve a perfect score."
