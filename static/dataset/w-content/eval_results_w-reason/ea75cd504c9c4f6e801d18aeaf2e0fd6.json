        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, focusing on self-discipline and time management as crucial skills learned in school. These are not particularly novel insights but are developed with examples and personal reflections, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from discussing the importance of these skills to personal anecdotes and broader implications. Transitions are mostly smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
