        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents several novel ideas beyond the introduction, such as the discovery of The Prophet's message and technology, the unification of global resistance movements, and the use of nanobots for both warfare and ecological restoration. These elements contribute to a fresh narrative angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the trial of President Hudson to the attack on the Swiss compound. Additionally, the introduction of the Prophet's daughter and the supercomputer feels somewhat rushed, affecting the overall flow."
