        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents fragmented and shallow ideas beyond the introduction. It introduces the concept of aliens awakening human power and humans being hunted by other humans turned into monsters, but these ideas are not developed in depth. The article lacks new insights or novel angles, resulting in a low idea score. In terms of coherence, the article is mostly smooth but has several awkward transitions. The narrative jumps from the awakening of power to the aliens' intentions and then to the chaos in the world without clear connections, leading to a coherence score of 2."
