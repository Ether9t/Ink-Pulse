        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the provision of free pads and tampons in schools. It highlights period poverty as a health issue and draws parallels with other necessities provided by schools, such as lunch for students who cannot afford it. However, it does not introduce particularly novel insights beyond these points, which is why it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, logical progression of arguments. It maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
