        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat novel idea by introducing a 'zombie pig' concept due to uranium exposure, which is a creative twist on the classic pig story. However, the development of this idea is fairly standard, focusing on the pig's attack and eventual redemption through familial love, which is a common narrative trope. Thus, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following the progression from the pig's transformation to his attack and eventual redemption. However, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden change from the attack to the resolution with the mother pig, which affects the overall flow. Therefore, it also scores a 3 for coherence."
