        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development about how technology affects dating, such as reducing anxiety and facilitating initial connections. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond personal anecdotes. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured narrative that smoothly transitions from discussing general experiences to specific personal stories, maintaining a consistent tone throughout."
