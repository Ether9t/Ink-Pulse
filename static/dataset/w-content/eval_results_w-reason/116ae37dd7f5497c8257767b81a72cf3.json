        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and imaginative scenario where Barack Obama is contacted by JFK, who is revealed to be alive and running a parallel world called Ganon 45. This concept of a parallel planet and the involvement of historical figures in a sci-fi narrative is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the narrative is generally coherent, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of green men and the saucer-shaped craft, which could have been more smoothly integrated into the story. The article maintains a consistent tone but could benefit from more detailed transitions between the different plot points."
