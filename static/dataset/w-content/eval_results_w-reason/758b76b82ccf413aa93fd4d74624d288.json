        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights and novel angles on the benefits of audiobooks, such as the ability to multitask while listening, the cost-effectiveness of audiobooks compared to physical books, and the personal experience of integrating audiobooks into a busy lifestyle. These points go beyond the introduction and offer a fresh perspective. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that flows naturally from one point to the next. The article maintains a consistent style and logical progression, though there are minor instances where transitions could be smoother, such as the shift from discussing multitasking to the therapeutic nature of reading."
