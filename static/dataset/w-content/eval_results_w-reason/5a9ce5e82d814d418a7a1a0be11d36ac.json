        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that college athletes should be compensated due to the revenue they generate and the professional-level expectations placed on them. However, it lacks novel insights or creative angles beyond these common arguments. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and progression of ideas, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt comparison to 'slave labor' without sufficient lead-in or context. Overall, the article is coherent but not exceptionally original in its ideas."
