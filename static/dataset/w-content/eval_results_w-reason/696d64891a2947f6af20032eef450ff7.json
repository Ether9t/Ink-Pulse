        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of Matt Damon forming a symbiotic relationship with aliens, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of Damon living part-time with aliens and using his experiences to create blockbuster movies is an original angle, contributing to a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from Damon's initial kidnapping to his eventual role in intergalactic diplomacy, earning a coherence score of 4. The narrative flows well, though there are minor jumps, such as the sudden introduction of an alien attack in 2041, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
