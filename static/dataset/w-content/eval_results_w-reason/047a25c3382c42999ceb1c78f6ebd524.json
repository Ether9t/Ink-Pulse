        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing the consequences of the drug Ivima, such as the violent behavior of the elderly and the societal response, including the execution of those affected. This provides a standard development of the initial premise, but lacks deeper exploration of the societal, ethical, or psychological implications, which limits the idea score to 3. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, moving from the discovery of side effects to the societal response. However, the transition from the description of the elderly's behavior to the government's actions and the resulting societal impact could be smoother, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
