        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by introducing the woman's realization of the commonalities among her dates and her subsequent investigation, which adds a layer of intrigue and development to the story. However, the idea of a shapeshifter trying to win over a love interest is not entirely novel, which limits the score to a 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is a 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the woman's suspicions to the confrontation and resolution. The transitions are mostly smooth, with a clear narrative arc, though there could be more depth in exploring the shapeshifter's perspective."
