        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea about the need for strong female characters in media, which is a well-discussed topic. However, it does develop the idea by suggesting that such portrayals could inspire real-world changes, like more women in leadership roles. This adds some depth, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and progression, moving from the problem of stereotypical portrayals to the potential societal impact of changing these narratives. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed."
