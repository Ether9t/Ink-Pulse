        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, discussing the shift in societal expectations of dads and the need for self-reflection. It touches on the changing role of dads and the importance of understanding their children's needs, which is a relevant but not particularly novel angle. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some awkward transitions, such as the abrupt mention of stay-at-home dads and the sudden conclusion about the rankings being a wake-up call. The article could benefit from smoother transitions and more in-depth exploration of the ideas presented."
