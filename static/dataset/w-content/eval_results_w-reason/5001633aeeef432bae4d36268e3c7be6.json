        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the preference for visual reading due to being a fast reader and the ability to control the reading order, which are common reasons for preferring physical books over audiobooks. However, it does not introduce particularly novel insights beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. The author logically explains their preference for reading over listening, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout."
