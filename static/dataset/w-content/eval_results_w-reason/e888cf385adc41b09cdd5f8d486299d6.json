        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents some standard ideas with moderate development, such as suggesting TV stations and promotional opportunities as alternative ways to compensate college athletes. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing potential benefits and downsides of paying athletes. However, there are some transitions that feel slightly abrupt, such as the shift from discussing TV networks to the potential impact on player motivation, which affects the overall flow. Therefore, the coherence score is also a 3."
