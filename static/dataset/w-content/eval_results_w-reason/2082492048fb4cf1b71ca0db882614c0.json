        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that helping animals is less common and that animal welfare organizations are often under-resourced. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing cultural norms to the need for more volunteers, which affects the flow. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
