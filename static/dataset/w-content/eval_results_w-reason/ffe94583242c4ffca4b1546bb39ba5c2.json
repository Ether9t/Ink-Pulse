        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other necessities like toilet paper and soap, and discussing the school's role in addressing period shaming. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and some natural transitions, but there are occasional uneven sections, such as the abrupt shift from discussing necessities to period shaming. Overall, the article is coherent but not exceptionally seamless or original."
