        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that individuals dictate their own level of risk and that extreme sports require proper preparation and mindset. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression, discussing personal choice, preparation, and the subjective nature of risk in sports. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency, though it doesn't delve deeply into new or original ideas beyond the introduction."
