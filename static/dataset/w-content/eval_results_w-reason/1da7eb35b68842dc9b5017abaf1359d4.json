        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard development of the initial concept, exploring the consequences of the ranking system and the government's response. The idea of a government-mandated ranking system and its repeal is a logical extension of the introduction, but it lacks deep originality or creative expansion, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. The article maintains a generally coherent structure, following a clear sequence of events from the introduction of the law to its repeal and the subsequent government apology. However, the transitions between sections are somewhat abrupt, and the narrative could benefit from smoother progression, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
