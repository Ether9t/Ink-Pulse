        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by suggesting the creation of a junior league for aspiring professional athletes, which is a novel angle not mentioned in the introduction. This idea contributes significantly to the discussion by proposing an alternative path for athletes focused on professional sports careers. However, the article's coherence is somewhat uneven. While it maintains a logical structure overall, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shift from discussing the risks athletes face to the proposal of a junior league, which could be more smoothly integrated. The article could benefit from more cohesive transitions between its main points."
