        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the concept of reincarnation through the metaphor of watching one's life as a film, and then expanding it to include the protagonist's intervention in another person's life. This adds depth and creativity beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is well-maintained with a clear narrative progression from watching one's own life to becoming involved in another's, though there are minor transitions that could be smoother, such as the abrupt shift from watching to intervening. Overall, the article is well-structured and maintains a consistent style, justifying a coherence score of 4."
