        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative impacts of increased screen time during the pandemic. It discusses health issues like eye strain and sedentary behavior, the impact on relationships, especially for children, and the loss of connection with the immediate world. These are common concerns but are articulated with some depth, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from health impacts to relational and societal impacts. The transitions between sections are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed throughout."
