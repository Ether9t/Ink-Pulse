        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a house made of depleted uranium, which is an original and creative idea. The narrative further develops with the wolf's attempts to destroy the house and the eventual collaboration between the pig and the wolf to rebuild it, adding depth and originality to the story. However, the coherence score is slightly lower due to some awkward transitions and logical inconsistencies, such as the wolf's sudden change of heart and the feasibility of building a house from uranium. Despite these issues, the article maintains a generally coherent structure with a clear progression of events."
