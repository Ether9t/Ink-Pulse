        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of global isolation and its consequences, which is a continuation of the introduction's premise. It explores the impact of isolation on first-world and third-world countries, but the insights are not particularly novel, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are some inconsistencies, such as the abrupt mention of the year 2112 and the lack of detailed explanation on how countries managed during isolation. The transitions between the economic impacts and the eventual conflicts could be smoother."
