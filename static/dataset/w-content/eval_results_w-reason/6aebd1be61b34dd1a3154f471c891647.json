        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to other hygiene products like toilet paper and soap, and the argument for providing them in schools to prevent embarrassment and maintain hygiene. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from personal anecdote to broader argument, maintaining a consistent tone and logical flow throughout."
