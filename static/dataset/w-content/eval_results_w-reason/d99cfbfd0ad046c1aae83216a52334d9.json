        "coherence_score": 4,

While the ideas are not particularly novel, they are developed with personal insights and examples, such as the emotional impact on people the author knows. This earns a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from identifying the stereotype to discussing its effects and concluding with a personal stance. Transitions are smooth, and the style is consistent throughout."
