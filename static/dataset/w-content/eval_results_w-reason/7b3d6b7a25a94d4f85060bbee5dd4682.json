        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article provides a personal anecdote to support the argument that schools should provide free pads and tampons, which adds a relatable and emotional dimension to the discussion. However, the idea itself is fairly standard and aligns with common arguments for providing menstrual products in schools, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from the personal story to the broader argument. The transitions are natural, and the narrative is consistent, though it could benefit from a more varied exploration of the topic beyond the personal experience."
