        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the societal and ethical implications of a life-extending drug. It expands on the introduction by discussing the socio-economic divide in drug access and the eventual mental deterioration of users, but it lacks deep exploration or novel insights into these issues, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the drug's introduction to its long-term effects and societal impact. However, the article occasionally feels uneven, particularly in the transition from the initial promise of the drug to the eventual disillusionment, justifying a coherence score of 3."
