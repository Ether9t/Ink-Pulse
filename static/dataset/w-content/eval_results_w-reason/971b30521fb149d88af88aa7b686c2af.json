        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of consent, physical and psychological testing, insurance, and equipment maintenance in sports. These are not particularly novel but are relevant to the discussion. The article also touches on the freedom of choice and the excitement of sports, which are common arguments in favor of risky sports. The coherence score is 3 because the article is generally coherent but has occasional unevenness. For example, the transition from discussing safety measures to the freedom of choice is somewhat abrupt, and the conclusion reiterates points without a strong logical progression. Overall, the article maintains a logical structure but could benefit from smoother transitions and deeper exploration of ideas."
