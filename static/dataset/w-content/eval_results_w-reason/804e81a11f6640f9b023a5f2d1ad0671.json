        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of multitasking with audiobooks and the potential for enhanced emotional connection when authors narrate their own works. However, these points are not particularly novel or deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of arguments. It maintains a consistent tone and logical flow, though it occasionally repeats points, such as the multitasking benefit, which slightly affects the overall smoothness."
