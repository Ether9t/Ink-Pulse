        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as balancing screen time with real-life interactions and the importance of maintaining personal connections. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or original, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, discussing the need for balance, the dangers of excessive screen time, and the importance of real-life interactions. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing personal interactions to monitoring children's screen time, which affects the overall flow, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
