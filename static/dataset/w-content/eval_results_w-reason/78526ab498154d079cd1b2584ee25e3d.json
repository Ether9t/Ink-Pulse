        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the positive impact of technology on communication and conflict resolution for introverted individuals, and the potential negative impact for extroverted individuals who prefer face-to-face interaction. These are not particularly novel insights but are developed with personal examples. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from personal experience to general observations, maintaining a consistent tone and logical flow throughout."
