        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that critical thinking and logical reasoning are important skills to learn in school, which is a common perspective. However, it does develop this idea by connecting it to current societal issues like misinformation and the importance of distinguishing between objective and personal facts. This provides some depth, earning it a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured, with a clear progression from personal experience to broader societal implications. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed throughout the piece."
