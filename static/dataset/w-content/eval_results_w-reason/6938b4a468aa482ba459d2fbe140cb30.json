        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of mugs changing to reflect actual rankings, leading to a global behavioral shift. This concept is original and explores the implications of being constantly judged, which is a fresh angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden societal changes and the introduction of a new deity, Mug, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
