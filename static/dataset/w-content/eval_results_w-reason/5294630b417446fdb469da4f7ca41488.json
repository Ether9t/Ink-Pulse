        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the impact of physical appearance on dating apps and the concept of dating becoming a numbers game. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The article also touches on the positive aspects of technology in dating, especially during the pandemic, which adds some depth. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or a deep exploration of new angles. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency throughout, with smooth transitions between points, earning it a higher coherence score."
