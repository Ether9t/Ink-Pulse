        "reason": "The article extends beyond the introduction by comparing extreme mountain climbing to boxing, highlighting risk awareness, personal choice, and the role of safety regulations. These provide clear new insights beyond the generic introduction. The structure is logical, moving from general discussion of risk to concrete examples and safety considerations, though some sentences are slightly repetitive, preventing a perfect coherence score."
