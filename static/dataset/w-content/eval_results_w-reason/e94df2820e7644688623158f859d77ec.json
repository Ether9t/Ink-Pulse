        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the competitive nature of men as a motivator for increased involvement in family life. This is a somewhat novel angle but not deeply explored, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the initial reaction of dads to the broader societal changes. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing dads' motivations to the broader societal impact, which affects the flow. Therefore, the coherence score is also a 3."
