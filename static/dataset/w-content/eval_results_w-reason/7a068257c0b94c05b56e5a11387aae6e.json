        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a resistance movement led by a determined individual, which is a common trope in post-apocalyptic or dystopian narratives. The concept of using local knowledge to fight back against occupiers is not particularly novel, but it is developed with some detail, such as the recruitment of former military personnel and the strategic use of the Rocky Mountains. Therefore, it merits a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following John's journey from forming a resistance to launching successful attacks. However, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden success of the resistance leading to the withdrawal of the Soviets and Chinese, which feels rushed and lacks detailed explanation. This results in a coherence score of 3."
