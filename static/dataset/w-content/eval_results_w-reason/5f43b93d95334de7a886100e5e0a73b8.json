        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that news is often negative and that important news will reach people regardless of their active engagement. These are not particularly novel insights but are developed with personal anecdotes and reasoning. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. The author consistently argues against the necessity of following the news, using personal experiences and opinions to support their stance. Transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
