        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article scores a 2 for New Idea because it primarily focuses on a predictable narrative of Obama choosing personal life over a mysterious job offer. The story doesn't expand much beyond the introduction's premise, offering a standard depiction of a retired life with no significant twists or novel insights. For Coherence, the article scores a 4 as it maintains a logical structure and smooth progression from the phone call with JFK to the dinner and evening with Michelle. The transitions between events are natural, and the style remains consistent throughout, though the narrative is straightforward and lacks complexity."
