        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing the concept of a house made of depleted uranium and the wolf's unexpected reaction to it. This adds a fresh angle to the narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The story further develops by exploring themes of misunderstanding and community integration, which are original and insightful. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the pig's realization of the danger of his house to the resolution of the wolf's loneliness. The transitions between the pig's gratitude, the wolf's loneliness, and the community's acceptance are smooth, though there are minor areas where the flow could be slightly more refined, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
