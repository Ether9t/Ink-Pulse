        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story, where the 92nd pig builds a house out of depleted uranium. The concept of the wolf using scientific ingenuity to convert uranium and force the pig out is creative and adds a new dimension to the story, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the wolf as a scientist and the lack of explanation for the glowing rods, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
