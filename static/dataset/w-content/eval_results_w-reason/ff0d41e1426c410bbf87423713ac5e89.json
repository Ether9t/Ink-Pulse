        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by exploring the emotional journey of the woman and the shapeshifter, adding depth to their relationship. However, the ideas are fairly standard, focusing on themes of trust and identity without introducing particularly novel concepts, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and smooth progression from the initial meeting to the resolution, with clear transitions between the woman's realizations and decisions. The narrative is consistent and well-paced, though it could benefit from more stylistic refinement to achieve a perfect score."
