        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the benefits of audiobooks, such as listening in the dark, changing speeds, and listening while driving. These are common points often discussed in the context of audiobooks, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. However, the article does offer a personal insight into how audiobooks aid in information retention, which adds some depth. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from one point to another, maintaining a consistent style throughout."
