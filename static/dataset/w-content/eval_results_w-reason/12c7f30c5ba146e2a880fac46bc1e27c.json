        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea about the 'evil stepmother' stereotype, which is a common trope in literature and media. The discussion about the character's cruelty and its impact on the story is somewhat developed but lacks depth or novel insights, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the stereotype's role in storytelling and its effects on the main character. However, the transitions between points are not entirely smooth, and the article occasionally feels uneven, which is why it scores a 3 for coherence."
