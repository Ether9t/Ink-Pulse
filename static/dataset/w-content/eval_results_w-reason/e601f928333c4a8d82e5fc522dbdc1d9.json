        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that individuals should decide their own risk levels and that proper training and equipment can mitigate risks. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from discussing personal choice to the benefits of extreme sports and the importance of safety measures. The distinction between extreme sports and reckless stunts is a useful clarification, contributing to coherence. However, the ideas could be more deeply explored to achieve a higher score in originality."
