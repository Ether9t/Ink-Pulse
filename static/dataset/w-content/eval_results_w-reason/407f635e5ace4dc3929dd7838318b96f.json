        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by highlighting the personal experiences of the author and Scottie Pippin, which adds a novel angle to the discussion about compensating college athletes. The mention of the author's own experience with a band scholarship and the struggles of athletes like Pippin provides a unique perspective that goes beyond the introduction. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing athletes to the author's personal experiences and the broader implications for band members. The article could benefit from smoother transitions and a more consistent focus."
