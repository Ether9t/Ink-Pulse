        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard development of the initial premise, exploring the reactions of the US and other countries to the isolation agreement. The idea of an invisible barrier is a novel angle, but it is not deeply explored, which limits the score to a 3 for new ideas. Coherence is generally maintained, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the invisible barrier without prior context, which affects the flow and results in a coherence score of 3."
