        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it explores the concept of JFK being alive and working on a secret project to create a new superpower. This idea is intriguing but not deeply original, as it follows a common trope of secret projects and hidden figures. The article does expand on the introduction by detailing JFK's motivations and the project's success, but it lacks multiple strong original ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical progression from Obama's discovery of the letter to the implementation of the project. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from Obama's skepticism to his agreement to help JFK, which affects the overall flow."
