        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is a creative and original idea. The wolf's attempt to disguise himself as a health inspector adds another layer of originality. However, the introduction of cancer as a recurring theme feels somewhat forced and detracts from the overall creativity. For coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, but the transition from the pig's escape to his subsequent cancer diagnosis is abrupt and jarring, affecting the flow. The story's tone shifts from whimsical to dark without a smooth transition, which impacts the coherence score."
