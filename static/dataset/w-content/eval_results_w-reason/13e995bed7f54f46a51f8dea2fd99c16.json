        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by introducing the concept of a pig building a house out of depleted uranium, which is both humorous and original. The dialogue between Frank and the wolf adds depth to the story, exploring the idea of seeking opportunities beyond familiar surroundings. This contributes to a new insight about exploring the wider world for success. The coherence is strong, with a clear narrative progression from Frank's initial problem to his eventual success. The transitions between dialogue and narrative are smooth, maintaining a consistent tone throughout. However, the article could have expanded more on Frank's journey to becoming the third richest pig, which would have enhanced both the idea and coherence scores."
