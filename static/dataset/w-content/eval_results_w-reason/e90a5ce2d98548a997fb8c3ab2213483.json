        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the protagonist being offered a job to help those affected by the drug's side effects and the decision to restore all memories. However, it lacks deeper exploration of the implications or ethical considerations of restoring memories, which could have added more originality. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden job offer and the quick resolution with the machine, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
