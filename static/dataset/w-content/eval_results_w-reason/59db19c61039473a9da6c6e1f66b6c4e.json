        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that schools should provide free pads and tampons, but it adds a condition that they should only be provided to students who qualify for government assistance. This adds a slight new angle to the discussion, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. However, the article does not deeply explore the implications or potential challenges of this approach. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent but has some unevenness. The transition from discussing period shaming to the logistics of providing products is somewhat abrupt, and the tone shifts slightly when the author mentions their personal perspective as a male. Overall, the article maintains a logical structure but could benefit from smoother transitions and more consistent stylistic elements."
