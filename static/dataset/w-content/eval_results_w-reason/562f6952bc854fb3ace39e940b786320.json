        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by emphasizing the importance of emotional intelligence as a critical skill learned in school, which is not typically highlighted in traditional educational discussions. This provides a novel angle beyond the introduction's general question about important school learnings. The article effectively argues that emotional intelligence is crucial for leadership and collaboration, supported by references to studies and real-world applications. For coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression from personal experience to broader implications, maintaining a consistent focus on emotional intelligence. However, it could benefit from more detailed examples or evidence to further strengthen the argument."
