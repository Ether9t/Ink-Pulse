        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article provides a standard exploration of the consequences of the immortality drug, focusing on the perspective of William, a member of the 'Lost Generations.' It expands on the introduction by detailing specific side effects such as unending hunger, obesity, and mental health issues, which are somewhat developed but not particularly novel. Thus, it earns a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following William's observations and experiences. However, the transitions between different side effects and William's reflections are somewhat abrupt, leading to a coherence score of 3."
