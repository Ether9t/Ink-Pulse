        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous concept of a miniature golf course being run as a 'United States of America' with Obama as its president, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This earns it a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the dialogue-driven narrative maintains a generally coherent structure, there are some abrupt transitions and a lack of depth in the explanation of the scenario, such as the sudden introduction of J. F. Krapp and the unclear role of the miniature golf course."
