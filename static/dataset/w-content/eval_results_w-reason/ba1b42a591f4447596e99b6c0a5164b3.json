        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing the concept of a house made of depleted uranium and the wolf's use of the internet to find a solution. This is a clear new insight, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the wolf's sudden decision to steal a firetruck, which could have been more smoothly integrated into the narrative."
