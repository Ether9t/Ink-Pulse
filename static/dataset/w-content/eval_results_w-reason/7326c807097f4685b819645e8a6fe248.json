        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by emphasizing the importance of teaching empathy and compassion in schools, which is a novel angle beyond the traditional focus on math and science. This contributes to a higher idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some transitions that feel slightly abrupt, such as the shift from discussing the importance of math and science to the need for empathy education. The article could benefit from smoother transitions between these topics."
