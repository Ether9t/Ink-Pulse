        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a humorous and somewhat novel twist on the idea of Matt Damon being frequently rescued, introducing a scenario with multiple Matt Damons and a comedic resolution. This adds some originality beyond the introduction, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. However, the narrative doesn't deeply explore the implications or expand significantly on the initial premise. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally consistent tone and logical progression, but the abrupt and somewhat absurd conclusion with Ben Affleck shooting both Matt Damons could be seen as jarring, leading to a coherence score of 3."
