        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of learning right from wrong and planning for the future. These are not particularly novel but are developed with examples of how they can be applied in various life areas. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from one idea to the next, discussing the importance of these skills and their applications in life. The transitions are smooth, and the article is stylistically consistent."
