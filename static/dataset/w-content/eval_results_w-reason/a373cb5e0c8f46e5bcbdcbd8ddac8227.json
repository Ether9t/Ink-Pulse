        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative with some development beyond the introduction. The twist of the bee being a fairy and granting wishes adds a layer of creativity, but the wishes themselves are quite predictable (beauty, wealth, a big house). The ending, where the protagonist dies due to forgetting to wish for a cure, adds a moral lesson about greed, which is a common trope. Thus, the idea score is 3. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden appearance of the real bee and the fairy's disappearance. The narrative flows logically, but the stylistic consistency could be improved, leading to a coherence score of 3."
