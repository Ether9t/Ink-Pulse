    "reason": "The article expands beyond the introduction with clear new insights: it explains why people empathize more with animals (defenselessness, easier identification, emotional reciprocity, long-term bonds) and provides multiple perspectives on the ethical question. The ideas are developed with supporting reasoning. Coherence is excellent, with smooth logical progression from one reason to the next and consistent stylistic tone throughout."
