        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion of embracing digital communication and the flexibility it offers. However, it lacks deep exploration or multiple strong original ideas, which limits the score to a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing personal preferences to societal implications, which affects the flow and unity, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
