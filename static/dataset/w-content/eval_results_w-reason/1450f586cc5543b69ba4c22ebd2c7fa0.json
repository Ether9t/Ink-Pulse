        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a house made of depleted uranium, which is an original and creative idea. The wolf's attempts to outsmart the pig, including trying to enter through the chimney and being fooled by a dummy pig, add further originality to the narrative. These elements contribute to a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression of events. The transitions between the wolf's attempts and the pig's responses are smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone throughout. However, the ending could have been slightly more developed to achieve a perfect score, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
