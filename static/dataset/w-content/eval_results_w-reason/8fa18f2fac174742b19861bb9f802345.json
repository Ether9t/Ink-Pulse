        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development regarding the portrayal of characters and the importance of empathy in making them 'real.' It uses examples like Captain Hastings from 'Line of Duty' and the protagonist from 'The Good Lawyer' to illustrate the point, but these insights are not particularly novel. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from the introduction of the idea to the examples provided. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article is stylistically consistent."
