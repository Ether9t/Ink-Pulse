        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the ability of technology to expand social circles and facilitate quick matching of potential partners. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency throughout, with smooth transitions between points."
