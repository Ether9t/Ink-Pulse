        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of screen time on physical health and the importance of monitoring and managing screen usage. It introduces the use of apps like Moment and Self Control as tools to help manage screen time, which adds some depth to the discussion. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from identifying the problem to suggesting solutions. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, warranting a score of 4 for coherence."
