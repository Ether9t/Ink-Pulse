        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of audiobooks during multitasking and their accessibility for children and the visually impaired. However, these points are relatively common and not particularly novel. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from discussing the benefits of audiobooks to the personal enjoyment of traditional reading. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
