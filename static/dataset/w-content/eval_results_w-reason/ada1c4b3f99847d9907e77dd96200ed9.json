        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a personal anecdote to support the claim that technology negatively affects dating, but it lacks depth and originality in its ideas. The narrative focuses on a single experience with a dating app, which is a common and somewhat shallow perspective, thus earning a score of 2 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 2 because the article is mostly a recounting of a personal story with abrupt shifts in tone, especially when discussing the encounter with Soeurette. The transitions between the narrative and the broader claim about technology's impact on dating are awkward, and the article lacks a clear, logical structure."
