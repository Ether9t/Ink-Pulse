        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that individuals have the freedom to define what is too dangerous for themselves and that all sports carry some risk. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights into the topic of extreme sports and their societal implications. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that flows logically from personal opinion to broader observations about risk in sports. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
