        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of former presidents having magic powers to fight aliens, which is a creative twist but not deeply explored. The narrative follows a typical sci-fi adventure trope without introducing multiple strong original ideas, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, with a clear sequence of events from receiving the letter to traveling to the future. However, the transition from disbelief to acceptance of the situation is somewhat abrupt, and the explanation of the powers and their use is not fully fleshed out, leading to occasional unevenness. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
