        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of audiobooks for those with limited time or concentration. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas, discussing the benefits of audiobooks in a cohesive manner. There are no abrupt shifts or jarring transitions, but the content could be more stylistically refined."
