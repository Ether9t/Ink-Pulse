        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that animals are seen as innocent and defenseless, and the suggestion for government intervention in human welfare. However, it lacks depth and originality, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is rated at 2 because the article has several awkward transitions and lacks a smooth flow. The argument jumps from discussing animal innocence to human scum without clear transitions, and the suggestion for government action feels abruptly introduced."
