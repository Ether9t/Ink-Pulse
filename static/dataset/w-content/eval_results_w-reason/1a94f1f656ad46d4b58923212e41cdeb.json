        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig who builds a house out of depleted uranium and faces a wolf with an army of cockroaches. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a coherent narrative with a logical progression from the wolf's initial failure to his clever use of cockroaches, and the subsequent bet, which adds a layer of humor and originality. The transitions are mostly smooth, with a clear structure and consistent style, justifying a coherence score of 4."
