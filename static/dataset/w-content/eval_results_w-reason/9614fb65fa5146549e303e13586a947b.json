        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that college athletes should be paid a percentage of ticket sales, which is a common argument in the debate about compensating college athletes. The suggestion that athletes receive compensation only after graduation is a slightly novel angle, but it lacks depth and exploration of potential implications. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, but there are some uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the fairness of payment to the impact on community goodwill. Overall, the article provides a basic development of ideas with some logical structure, but it could benefit from more detailed exploration and smoother transitions."
