        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents some standard ideas with development, such as the unexpected twist of the U.S. being the only nation to adhere to the isolation agreement and the subsequent rise of a new U.S. Empire under Soeurette Morley. However, the narrative quickly devolves into a personal drama involving Soeurette's family, which detracts from the initial geopolitical premise. The idea of a rekindled romance and subsequent betrayal adds a layer of complexity but feels somewhat disconnected from the broader theme of global isolation and conquest. Coherence is rated at 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, particularly the abrupt shift from geopolitical strategy to personal vendetta, and the sudden resolution with Tyler's leadership. The narrative lacks a smooth progression and feels disjointed, especially with the rapid escalation and resolution of conflicts."
