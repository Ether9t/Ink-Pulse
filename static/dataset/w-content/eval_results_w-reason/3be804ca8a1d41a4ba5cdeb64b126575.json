        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of the drug causing a dementia-like state and the government being compromised. However, it lacks depth and originality beyond the introduction, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the protagonist's actions to the global impact of the drug. The narrative jumps from personal action to a global outcome without a smooth transition, affecting the overall flow."
