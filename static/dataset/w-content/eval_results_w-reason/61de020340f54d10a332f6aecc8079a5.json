        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the focus on personal growth and local community involvement over national or global news consumption. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, moving from the drawbacks of consuming news to the benefits of focusing on local and personal matters. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed throughout."
