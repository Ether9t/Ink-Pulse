        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a person dealing with a bee despite a severe allergy, which is a logical continuation of the introduction. The narrative explores the internal conflict and fear of the protagonist, which adds some depth but doesn't introduce highly original concepts beyond the initial setup. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured, maintaining a logical flow as it describes the protagonist's thoughts and fears. The transitions between the protagonist's thoughts and observations are smooth, earning it a coherence score of 4."
