        "reason": "The article provides a standard expansion on the introduction's premise, discussing the consequences of the immortality drug and the motivations of the researchers. It introduces the idea of societal greed and the exploitation of human desires, which adds some depth but is not particularly novel. The article's coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the discovery of side effects to the societal reaction and the moral lesson. However, there are occasional abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift to the researchers' fate and the concluding life lesson, which slightly disrupt the flow."
