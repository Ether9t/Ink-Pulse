        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by suggesting that schools pay athletes but hold the money in trust until they graduate or turn 35. This approach addresses concerns about the immediate impact of money on students and offers a solution to NCAA exploitation, which is a fresh angle beyond the introduction. The article also tackles the issue of poorer schools being forced out of the market, arguing that if they can't afford to pay, they shouldn't be in the business, which adds depth to the discussion. However, it doesn't explore multiple new ideas, so it scores a 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression of arguments. It transitions smoothly from discussing the exploitation of athletes to proposing a solution and addressing potential counterarguments, earning it a coherence score of 4."
