        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on reincarnation by depicting it as a cinematic experience where one watches their next life unfold. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The narrative of choosing a private box seat to observe the next life and the development of the little girl's character as she grows and questions the world adds depth to the concept. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the choice of seat to the unfolding of the film. The transitions between the girl's life stages and the intermission are smooth, though the abrupt ending with the philosophical question could have been more seamlessly integrated."
