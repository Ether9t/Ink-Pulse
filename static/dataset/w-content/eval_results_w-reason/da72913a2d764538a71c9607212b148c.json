        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the financial burden of menstruation and the comparison to other essential products provided in schools. However, it lacks truly novel insights or creative angles beyond these points. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that logically progresses from the financial implications to the social and gender equality aspects. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone and style throughout."
