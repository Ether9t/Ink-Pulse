        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that people view animals as more innocent and helpless compared to humans, which is a common perspective. It also discusses the idea that focusing on one cause doesn't mean neglecting the other, which is a reasonable but not particularly novel argument. Therefore, the idea score is 3. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains a logical structure and has smooth transitions between points, earning it a coherence score of 4."
