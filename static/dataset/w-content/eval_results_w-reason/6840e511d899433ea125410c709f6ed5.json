        "reason": "The article extends the introduction by adding the shapeshifter's repeated attempts to win the woman's heart and his eventual transformation into a predator, which is a somewhat creative twist. However, the ideas are predictable once the shapeshifter motif is established, and the ending is abrupt and jarring. Coherence is moderate: most of the article flows logically, but the final twist (he eats her, then decides to pursue a man) disrupts the narrative consistency and feels sudden."
