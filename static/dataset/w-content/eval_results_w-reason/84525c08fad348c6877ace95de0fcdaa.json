        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat novel idea by introducing a fictional scenario where past presidents communicate with successors through stored personalities. This concept is intriguing and adds a layer of originality, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. However, the execution of this idea is fragmented, particularly with the abrupt shift from buying a gun to the extreme suggestion of killing people in the Oval Office, which lacks depth and development. For coherence, the article struggles with maintaining a logical structure. The transition from the phone call with JFK to the drastic action of buying a gun and the subsequent instructions is jarring and lacks a natural progression, resulting in a coherence score of 2."
