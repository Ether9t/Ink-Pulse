        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the importance of reading, writing, and math, which are well-known foundational skills. The discussion on how these skills are interconnected and essential for understanding the world is developed but not particularly novel, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with clear transitions between the importance of reading, writing, and math. The stylistic consistency is maintained throughout, making the article well-structured."
