        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative portrayal of African-American characters in media, specifically focusing on the 'Mammy' stereotype from 'Gone with the Wind.' It discusses the desire for more positive and independent portrayals of African-Americans, which is a common critique but is developed with some personal insight. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, moving from the specific example of 'Mammy' to broader stereotypes and concluding with a call for positive representation. The transitions are smooth, and the stylistic consistency is maintained throughout."
