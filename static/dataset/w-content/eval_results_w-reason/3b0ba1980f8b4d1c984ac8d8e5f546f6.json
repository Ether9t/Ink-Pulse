        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a basic argument against stereotypical characters, emphasizing their discriminatory nature and lack of realism. However, it lacks depth and originality, as it reiterates common criticisms without offering new insights or examples, resulting in a score of 2 for New Idea. The coherence score is 3 because the article maintains a generally logical structure, but it has some repetitive statements and lacks smooth transitions between points, which affects the overall flow."
