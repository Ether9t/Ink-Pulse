        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the potential for an open market and the focus on education as a form of compensation. However, it lacks novel insights or creative expansion beyond the introduction. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and clear progression of arguments, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the open market to the issue of intellectual athletes. Overall, the article is coherent but not exceptionally original in its ideas."
