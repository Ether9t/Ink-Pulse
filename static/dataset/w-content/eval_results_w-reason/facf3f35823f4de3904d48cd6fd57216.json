        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that following the news is a personal choice and that certain news, like during a pandemic, is essential. However, it lacks deep exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the negative impact of news to the potential positive impact of engaging with current events. Overall, the article is coherent but could benefit from smoother transitions and more original ideas."
