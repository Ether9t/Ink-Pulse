        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of audiobooks for multitasking and the potential for auditory learners to benefit more from listening. However, these points are relatively common and do not offer particularly novel insights, resulting in an idea score of 3. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from the benefits of audiobooks to the limitations compared to reading. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
