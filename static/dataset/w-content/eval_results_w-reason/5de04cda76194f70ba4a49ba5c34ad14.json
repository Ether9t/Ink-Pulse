        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights by challenging the current NCAA system and highlighting the disparity between the ideal of college athletics and the reality. It argues that the current system is unfair and suggests that paying athletes could allow them to pursue education more flexibly. This is a novel angle that goes beyond the introduction. The article is well-structured, with a logical progression from critiquing the current system to proposing a solution. However, it could benefit from more detailed examples or data to support its claims, which is why it did not receive a perfect score in either category."
