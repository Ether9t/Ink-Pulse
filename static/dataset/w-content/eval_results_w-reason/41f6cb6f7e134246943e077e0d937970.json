        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a scenario where former presidents, including JFK, are involved in a secretive mission to conquer death. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is also strong, with a well-structured narrative that smoothly transitions from Obama's initial reaction to the mysterious note, to his interaction with other former presidents, and finally to the revelation of the facility's purpose. The article maintains a consistent tone and logical progression, justifying a coherence score of 4."
