        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and uses a phony Geiger counter to outsmart the wolf. This is a creative and original idea, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the story maintains a generally consistent tone and logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the wolf being knocked out to being cooked in the oven. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed development of certain plot points."
