        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of screen time for education and social interaction, particularly during the pandemic. It discusses how technology facilitates learning and social connections, which are not entirely novel but are relevant and expanded upon with personal examples. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It transitions smoothly from discussing educational benefits to social and technological comfort, and finally to the importance of moderation, making it well-structured overall."
