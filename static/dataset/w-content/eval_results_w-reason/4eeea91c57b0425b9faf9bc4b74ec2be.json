        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a dystopian future where the U.S. becomes a fascist power, which is a common trope in speculative fiction. However, it does expand on the introduction by detailing the president's actions and the global response, which adds some depth, earning it a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is rated at 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, such as the sudden shift from the president's speech to the global reaction, and the abrupt conclusion about a thousand-year rule. The narrative lacks smooth progression and stylistic consistency."
