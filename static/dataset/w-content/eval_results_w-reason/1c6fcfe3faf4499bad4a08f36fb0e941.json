        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the distinction between stereotypes that are the sole focus of a character (e.g., the dumb blonde) versus those that are part of a more complex character (e.g., Tony Soprano, Walter White). This is a common discussion in media analysis, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from discussing specific stereotypes to broader societal implications, earning a coherence score of 4. The transitions between points are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed throughout."
