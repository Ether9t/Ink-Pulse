        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that pursuing extreme sports is a form of personal growth and learning, and compares the risks of extreme sports to everyday activities like driving. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that flows logically from the introduction of the idea to the conclusion. The article maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, with clear transitions between points."
