        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that uses depleted uranium for protection, which is a creative and original idea. This adds a new dimension to the story, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a coherent narrative with a logical progression from the pig confronting the wolf to the wolf's eventual demise due to radiation poisoning. The dialogue between the pig and the wolf is consistent and contributes to the story's flow, though there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother. Overall, the article is well-structured, justifying a coherence score of 4."
