        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on the consequences of a drug that grants immortality, introducing the concept of aging backwards with severe mental health side effects. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the mad scientist's intentions and the collaboration with beer brewing companies, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
