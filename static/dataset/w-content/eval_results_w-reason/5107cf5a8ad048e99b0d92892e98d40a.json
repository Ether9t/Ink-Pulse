        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights, such as the importance of filtering news for mental health and the emphasis on being informed for civic participation, which go beyond the introduction. It discusses the balance between staying informed and maintaining mental well-being, and the role of empathy and perspective in understanding global events. These are novel angles that contribute to the discussion. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that progresses logically from the importance of being informed to the need for filtering information. Transitions are mostly smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
