        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the shapeshifter's strategy to win the woman's affection by appearing as different people in her life. However, it lacks deeper exploration of the shapeshifter's motivations or the woman's emotional journey, which could have added more originality. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the hotel scene to the work environment, and the sudden realization of the shapeshifter's success. The narrative feels somewhat disjointed, and the progression of events lacks smoothness."
