        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a shallow expansion of the introduction's premise, focusing mainly on the protagonist's panic and physical reactions without exploring deeper implications or novel ideas about the bee's communication or the protagonist's allergy. The narrative lacks depth and creativity, resulting in a fragmented idea score of 2. Coherence is also rated at 2 due to awkward transitions and repetitive phrasing, such as the excessive use of 'ran and ran' and the abrupt shift from panic to relief without a clear resolution or exploration of the bee's significance."
