        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat shallow exploration of the concept introduced. The idea of a woman dating the same shapeshifter repeatedly is intriguing, but the article does not expand significantly beyond the introduction. It focuses more on Helena's internal realization and emotional growth, which is a common narrative in romantic stories, thus earning a score of 2 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following Helena's journey from self-doubt to self-discovery and love. However, the transition from her realization to meeting Ben feels somewhat abrupt, and the shapeshifter element is not explored further, leading to a coherence score of 3."
