        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of reincarnations watching their next life unfold and the metaphor of following the 'white rabbit' as a life choice. However, it doesn't delve deeply into these ideas, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured narrative and clear progression from the conversation to the movie's end, earning a score of 4. The dialogue and transitions are natural, maintaining a consistent tone throughout."
