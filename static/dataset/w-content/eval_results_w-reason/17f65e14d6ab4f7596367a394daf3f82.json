        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by introducing the concepts of Drakon, Guardians, and Rogues, as well as the soulstone device, which adds depth to the narrative. However, these ideas are somewhat standard within the fantasy genre, leading to a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from the introduction of Drakon to the conflict between Guardians and Rogues. The transitions are smooth, and the article remains stylistically consistent throughout."
