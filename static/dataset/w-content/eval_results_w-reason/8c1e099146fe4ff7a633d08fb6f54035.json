        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other hygiene products like toilet paper and soap, and discussing the stigma surrounding menstruation. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that progresses logically from the need for comfort and hygiene to addressing potential concerns about cost and stigma. The article maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, contributing to its overall clarity and readability."
