        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and imaginative scenario where individuals over 85 who take the anti-aging drug turn into giant rats, leading to the creation of 'Rat City.' This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden transformation of Rosa and the quick shift to the societal response with 'Rat City.' The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed development of the societal implications."
