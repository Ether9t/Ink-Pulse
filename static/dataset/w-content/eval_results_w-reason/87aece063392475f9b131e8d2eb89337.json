        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that extreme sports require training and preparation similar to other sports, and that the decision to engage in them is subjective. However, it lacks deep exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the spirit of sports to the safety measures in extreme sports. The article could benefit from a more structured progression and deeper exploration of new ideas."
