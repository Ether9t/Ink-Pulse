        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the pros and cons of dating apps, Netflix, social media, and texting in the context of dating. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated and relevant to the topic. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing each technological aspect in turn and balancing positives and negatives effectively. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
