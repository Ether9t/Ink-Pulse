        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the twist of the wolf wanting to build a similar house and the pig's talent in building. However, the concept of the pig being tricked into signing away his house is a common trope, limiting the originality. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the wolf's initial admiration to the petition trick. The narrative maintains a logical structure but could benefit from smoother transitions and more stylistic consistency."
