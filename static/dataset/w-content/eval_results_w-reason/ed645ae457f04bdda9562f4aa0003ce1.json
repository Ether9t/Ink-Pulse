        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of mana being used as a substitute for modern technology and financial transactions, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This earns it a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden mention of aliens destroying New York without much buildup or connection to the previous narrative about mana usage in daily life. The stylistic consistency is mostly maintained, but the shift in focus from personal anecdotes to a global event could have been smoother."
