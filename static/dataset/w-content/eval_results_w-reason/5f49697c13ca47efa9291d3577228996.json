        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the compensation of college athletes. It highlights the risks athletes take and the financial benefits they bring to colleges, which are common arguments in this debate. However, it does not introduce significantly new insights or novel angles beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing athlete risks to the financial status of the NCAA, which affects the flow. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
