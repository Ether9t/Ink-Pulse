        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of technology on dating. It contrasts past dating experiences with current trends, highlighting the impersonal nature of dating apps. However, it doesn't offer particularly novel insights beyond this comparison. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with a personal anecdote effectively illustrating the author's perspective. The narrative is consistent and transitions smoothly from personal experience to broader commentary on technology's impact."
