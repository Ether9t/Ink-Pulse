        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that student-athletes should receive a share of the profits they help generate, which is a common perspective in the debate about paying college athletes. It also touches on the existing advantages of big sports programs, which is a relevant point but not particularly novel. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured and maintains a logical flow, with clear transitions between points, such as moving from the financial contributions of athletes to the fairness of profit distribution. This earns it a coherence score of 4."
