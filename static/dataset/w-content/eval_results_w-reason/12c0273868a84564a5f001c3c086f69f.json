        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is an original and creative idea. The concept of the wolf consulting a scientist and the pig using a special type of uranium adds depth and originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is well-maintained with a logical progression from the wolf's initial failure to the pig's explanation of the special uranium, and the wolf's subsequent frustration. The narrative flows smoothly with clear transitions, justifying a coherence score of 4."
