        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development about how technology facilitates meeting people and forming relationships. It shares personal anecdotes to support the claim that technology is beneficial for dating, which adds some depth but lacks novel insights. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from personal experiences to broader conclusions. However, the transitions between personal stories and general statements could be smoother, and the article occasionally shifts abruptly between topics, such as moving from dating to friendships formed through gaming."
