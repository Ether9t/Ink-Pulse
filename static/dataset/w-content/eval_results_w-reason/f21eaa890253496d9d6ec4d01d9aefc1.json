        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative of betrayal and realization, which is a common theme in literature and media. The idea of the mug revealing the true ranking of dads is novel, but the article doesn't expand much beyond the initial premise, focusing instead on a personal drama that unfolds predictably. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, moving from the protagonist's discovery to confrontation and resolution. However, the transition from the mug's revelation to the protagonist's suspicion and subsequent confrontation feels somewhat rushed and lacks depth, leading to a coherence score of 3."
