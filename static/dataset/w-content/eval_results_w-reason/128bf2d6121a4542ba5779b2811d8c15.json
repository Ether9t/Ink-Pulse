        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of immortals requiring the flesh of the 'Lost Generation' to maintain their vitality, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of human farms and the eventual genetic anomaly that reverses the immortality drug are also original ideas, contributing to a high idea score. However, the coherence score is slightly lower due to some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the young boy with a genetic anomaly without much context or buildup. The narrative jumps quickly from the immortals' actions to the resolution, which affects the overall flow and cohesion."
