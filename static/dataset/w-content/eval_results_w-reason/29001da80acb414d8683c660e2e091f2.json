        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by focusing on the 20th little pig, who builds a unique underground bunker to avoid predators, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction's mention of the 92nd pig. This idea of a pig community living underground is original and adds depth to the story, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the survival of the 20th pig to the establishment of a community. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the narrative is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
