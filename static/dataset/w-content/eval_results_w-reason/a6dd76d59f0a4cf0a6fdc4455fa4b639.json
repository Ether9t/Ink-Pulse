        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the distinction between 'good' and 'bad' screen time and the concept of 'life time' as an alternative to screen time. These ideas are not particularly novel but are developed with some depth. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from identifying the problem to suggesting solutions, such as encouraging real-world interaction. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
