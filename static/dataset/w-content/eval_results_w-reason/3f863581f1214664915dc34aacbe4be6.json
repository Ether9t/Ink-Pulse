        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by exploring the development of magical abilities among the survivors and the societal dynamics that emerge, such as the competitive nature of the Last Ones. This provides a standard level of development beyond the introduction, but it doesn't introduce highly original ideas, hence a score of 3 for New Idea. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, moving from the development of powers to the societal impact and eventual alien attack. However, the transition from competition to the alien attack feels somewhat abrupt, and the moral conclusion is a bit forced, leading to a coherence score of 3."
