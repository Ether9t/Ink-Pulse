        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of listening to audiobooks while doing chores and the benefit for the vision impaired. However, these points are relatively common and not particularly novel, resulting in an idea score of 3. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains a logical flow from one point to the next, discussing various advantages of audiobooks in a cohesive manner."
