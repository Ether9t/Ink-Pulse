        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the protagonist building a hive and negotiating with the bee to ensure safety from stings. These elements expand on the introduction but do not introduce highly original concepts, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the protagonist's surprise to their acceptance of the role as queen, with clear transitions between actions and dialogue. However, it lacks the seamless flow and stylistic refinement needed for a perfect score."
