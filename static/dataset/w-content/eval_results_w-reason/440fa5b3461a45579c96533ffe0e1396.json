        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a few standard ideas about screen time, such as the importance of taking breaks and the benefits of technology, but it lacks depth and originality, resulting in a score of 2 for new ideas. The argument that technology is here to stay and that we should embrace it is not particularly novel. The coherence score is 3 because the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are some repetitive elements, such as the repeated emphasis on taking breaks, which slightly disrupts the flow. Overall, the article is coherent but lacks significant development or new insights."
