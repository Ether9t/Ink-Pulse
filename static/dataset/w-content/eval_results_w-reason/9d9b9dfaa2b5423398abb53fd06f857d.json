        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by emphasizing the importance of teaching practical life skills in high school, such as filing taxes and job preparation, which are not typically part of the standard curriculum. This is a novel angle that goes beyond the introduction's general question about important things to learn in school. The article also discusses the gap between high school and college education in terms of practical skills, which adds depth to the argument. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression from identifying the problem to suggesting a solution. The transitions between discussing personal experiences and broader educational needs are smooth, maintaining a consistent tone throughout."
