        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative impact of screen time, such as disengagement and isolation, which are commonly discussed issues. It does not introduce particularly novel insights beyond the introduction, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, discussing various contexts like school, work, and home, but it lacks a strong, seamless flow and has some repetitive elements, leading to a coherence score of 3."
