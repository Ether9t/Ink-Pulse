        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of collaboration, flexibility, and goal-setting, which are common themes in educational discourse. It does not introduce particularly novel insights beyond these well-established concepts, hence the idea score of 3. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, discussing personal experiences and how they relate to the broader topic. However, there are occasional awkward transitions, such as the shift from personal experiences to general advice, which affects the overall flow, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
