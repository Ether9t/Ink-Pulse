        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a strong opinion against audiobooks, but it lacks depth and originality in its arguments, resulting in a fragmented and shallow exploration of the topic. The idea score is 2 because the article primarily reiterates common criticisms of audiobooks without offering new insights or novel angles. The coherence score is also 2, as the article has a disjointed structure with abrupt shifts in tone, such as the exaggerated claim about COVID and the unrelated political commentary. These elements disrupt the logical flow and stylistic consistency of the piece."
