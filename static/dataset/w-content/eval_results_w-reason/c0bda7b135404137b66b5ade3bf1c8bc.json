        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the shapeshifter's struggle and his mother's advice. It doesn't introduce many new insights beyond the introduction, but it does expand on the shapeshifter's internal conflict and his relationship with his mother, which adds some depth. The coherence is strong, with a clear structure and natural progression from Rick's attempts to his conversation with his mother. The dialogue and narrative flow smoothly, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
