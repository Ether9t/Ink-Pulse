        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a person realizing the importance of bees and deciding to take action, which is a common narrative. However, it does introduce a slightly novel angle with the bee communicating directly and humorously with the protagonist, which adds some originality. The coherence is mostly smooth but has awkward transitions, such as the sudden shift from ordering pizza to discussing pesticides, and the protagonist's quick change of heart without much development. The article could benefit from more logical progression and deeper exploration of the protagonist's realization."
