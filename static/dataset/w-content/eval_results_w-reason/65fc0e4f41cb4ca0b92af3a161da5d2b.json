        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the importance of time management and communication skills, which are commonly discussed as essential life skills. The author provides personal anecdotes to support these ideas, but they do not introduce particularly novel insights beyond the introduction. Therefore, the idea score is 3. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from the introduction of the skills to personal examples and a conclusion. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout, warranting a coherence score of 4."
