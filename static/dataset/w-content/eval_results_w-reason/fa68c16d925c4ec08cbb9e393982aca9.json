        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of audiobooks in specific scenarios like commuting or before bed, and their accessibility for people who can't read or see. However, these points are relatively common and not particularly novel, resulting in an idea score of 3. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It smoothly transitions between discussing the benefits of audiobooks, personal preferences, and the comparison with physical books, maintaining a consistent tone throughout."
