        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by exploring the woman's interactions with the shapeshifter and her consultation with a psychic, which adds some depth to the narrative. However, the ideas remain fairly standard and predictable, lacking significant originality or depth beyond the initial premise, which is why it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are some awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the psychic's revelation to the woman's confrontation with the shapeshifter. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more stylistic consistency, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
