        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the issue of stereotypical characters in media. It discusses the lack of creativity and depth in such portrayals and expresses a desire for more original and complex characters. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It smoothly transitions from discussing the general problem of stereotypes to specific examples like the 'dumb blonde' trope and concludes with a personal stance against stereotypes. The article is stylistically consistent and well-structured."
