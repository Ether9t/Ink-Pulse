        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that animals are perceived as more helpless than humans, which is why people might empathize more with them. It also touches on the moral implications of choosing to focus on animal welfare over human suffering, suggesting a balance is needed. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It maintains a logical flow from discussing empathy towards animals to the moral considerations of focusing on animal welfare, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
