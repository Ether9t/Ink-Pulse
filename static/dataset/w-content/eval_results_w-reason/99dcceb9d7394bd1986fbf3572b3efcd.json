        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding how technology can worsen romantic interactions. It discusses issues like stalking, surveillance, and the decline of face-to-face interactions, which are common concerns in discussions about technology and dating. However, it does not introduce particularly novel insights or angles beyond these well-trodden points, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing surveillance to the decline of traditional values, which affects the flow. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
