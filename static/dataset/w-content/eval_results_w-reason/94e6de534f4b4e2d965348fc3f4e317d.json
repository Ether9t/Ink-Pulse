        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the introduction's premise of being the 'controller of the bees' and introduces the concept of a hidden identity and purpose as the Keeper of the Bees. This adds depth and originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The narrative progresses logically from the initial encounter with the bee to the discovery of the cave and the carvings, maintaining a clear structure and natural transitions. However, the transition from the discovery to the decision to 'wipe out the polluters' could be more developed, which is why the coherence score is 4."
