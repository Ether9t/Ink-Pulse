        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that the decision to engage in extreme sports is personal and hinges on whether others are endangered. This is a common perspective, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. However, it does touch on specific scenarios like inclement weather and the responsibilities of rescuers, which adds some depth. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure, discussing the personal choice aspect and the potential impact on others in a clear and organized manner. Transitions between points are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed."
