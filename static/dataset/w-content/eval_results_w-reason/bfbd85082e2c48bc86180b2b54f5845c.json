        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the wolf's unexpected willingness to help the pig and the twist ending where the wolf eats the pig. These elements add a novel angle to the classic story, but they are not deeply explored or particularly original. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the wolf's warning to the construction of the new house. However, the abrupt ending where the wolf eats the pig feels jarring and disrupts the flow, preventing a higher coherence score."
