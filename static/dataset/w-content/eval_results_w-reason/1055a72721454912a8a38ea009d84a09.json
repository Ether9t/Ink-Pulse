        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it introduces the concept of former presidents being immortal and part of a secret group aiming to take over the world. This is a somewhat novel angle, but it doesn't deeply expand beyond the initial premise. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from Obama finding the letter to meeting JFK and learning about the secret group. However, the transition from disbelief to acceptance is somewhat abrupt, and the narrative could benefit from more detailed development to enhance the flow and depth."
