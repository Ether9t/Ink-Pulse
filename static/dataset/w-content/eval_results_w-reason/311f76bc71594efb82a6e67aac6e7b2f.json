        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that college athletes should be allowed to receive money from outside sources, which is a common argument in the debate about compensating college athletes. It does not introduce any particularly novel insights or angles beyond the introduction, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the potential benefits of athletes receiving money and addressing counterarguments. However, the transitions between points are somewhat abrupt, and the argument could be more smoothly developed, leading to a coherence score of 3."
