        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a shallow expansion of the introduction's premise. The new idea introduced is the woman's realization about the shapeshifter's fashion sense, which is a superficial reason for the relationship failures. This idea lacks depth and creativity, resulting in a score of 2 for new ideas. Coherence is also rated at 2 because the article has awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the woman's discovery to her decision to confront him. The resolution is also sudden and lacks a natural progression, making the narrative feel disjointed."
