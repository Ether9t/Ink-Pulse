        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a viewpoint that prioritizes human welfare over animal welfare, but it does not offer much new or original thinking beyond the introduction. The ideas are somewhat fragmented and shallow, focusing on a religious perspective and political grievances without deeply exploring the ethical implications of the topic. The coherence is also lacking, as the article jumps between topics such as religion, politics, and social issues without smooth transitions, leading to a disjointed reading experience."
