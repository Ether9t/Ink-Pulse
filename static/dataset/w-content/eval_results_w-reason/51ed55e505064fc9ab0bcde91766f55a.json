        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed for democratic participation and the challenges posed by misinformation and sensationalism. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from discussing the challenges of keeping up with the news to the responsibilities of citizens, maintaining a consistent tone throughout."
