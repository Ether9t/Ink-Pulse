        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of communication through technology and the role of dating apps in easing the initial stages of dating. However, these points are relatively common and lack deep exploration, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from one point to another, such as moving from communication benefits to the role of Netflix in bonding, which earns it a coherence score of 4."
