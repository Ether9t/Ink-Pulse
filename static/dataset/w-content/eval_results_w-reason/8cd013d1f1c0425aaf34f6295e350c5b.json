These are common points in the audiobook vs. reading debate, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It starts with the benefits of audiobooks, moves to the advantages of physical books, and concludes with a personal preference, maintaining a logical flow throughout."
