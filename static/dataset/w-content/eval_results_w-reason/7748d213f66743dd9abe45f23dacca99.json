        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that the line of what is considered too dangerous is subjective and varies from person to person. It discusses personal choice and the diversity of human preferences, which are not particularly novel but are developed adequately. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from personal opinion to broader reflections on human diversity in risk-taking. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone, earning it a coherence score of 4."
