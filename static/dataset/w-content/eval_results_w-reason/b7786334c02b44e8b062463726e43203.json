        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a fragmented narrative with shallow ideas beyond the introduction. The main new idea is the protagonist's decision to stay indoors and work from home, which is not deeply explored or expanded upon. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the hospital experience to the decision to stay indoors. The narrative lacks depth and development, resulting in a score of 2 for new ideas and 3 for coherence."
