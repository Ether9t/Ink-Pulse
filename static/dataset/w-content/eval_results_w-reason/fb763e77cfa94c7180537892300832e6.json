        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by introducing the concept of government policy as the true 'side effect' of the immortality drug, which is a significant expansion beyond the introduction. This idea of a lottery system for population control adds depth and originality, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the revelation of the side effects to the protagonist's meeting with the friend, and finally to the resolution of the conspiracy. The transitions are mostly smooth, though there are minor instances where the narrative could be more seamless, such as the abrupt shift from the friend's revelation to the protagonist's acceptance of the plan. Overall, the article is well-structured, justifying a coherence score of 4."
