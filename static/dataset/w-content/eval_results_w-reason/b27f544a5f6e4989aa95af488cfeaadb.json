        "reason": "The article presents a standard argument against extreme mountain climbing, focusing on the risks and potential selfishness involved. It does not introduce many new ideas beyond the introduction, but it does expand on the emotional impact on families, which adds some depth. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are moments where the argument feels repetitive, and the transition to legal considerations feels abrupt. Overall, the article is coherent but lacks a seamless flow and originality in its ideas."
