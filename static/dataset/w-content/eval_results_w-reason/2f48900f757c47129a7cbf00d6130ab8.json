        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that people naturally prioritize those they know, including animals, over strangers, which is a common perspective. It does introduce the notion of focusing on billionaires' responsibilities, which adds some depth, but it is not a highly novel concept. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing personal capability and the role of billionaires, but it occasionally lacks smooth transitions, such as the abrupt shift from personal responsibility to billionaire responsibility. Thus, it scores a 3 for coherence."
