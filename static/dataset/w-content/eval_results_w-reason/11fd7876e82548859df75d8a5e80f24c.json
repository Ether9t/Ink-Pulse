        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig who builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is an original and creative idea. The narrative further develops with the introduction of Dr. Cornelius Oliver, a scientist pig, and his clever brother Smith, who uses lead for his house. These elements contribute to a fresh take on the story, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the wolf's attempts to blow down the houses to the resolution with the fox. The transitions between events are smooth, and the style is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
