        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights, such as the idea that focusing on animal welfare does not necessarily detract from addressing human suffering, and that human actions have contributed significantly to animal suffering, which may drive empathy. It also discusses the psychological aspect of why people might empathize more with animals. These are novel angles beyond the introduction. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that logically progresses from the causes of animal suffering to the justification for focusing on it, and finally to the interconnectedness of human and animal welfare. There are no abrupt shifts, and the transitions are natural, though the article could benefit from slightly more stylistic refinement to achieve a perfect score."
