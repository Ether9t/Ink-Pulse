        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the impact of news on mental health and the notion that people should be aware of major events without being overwhelmed by constant news consumption. However, it lacks deep exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and progression of ideas, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the impact of media to personal anecdotes about stress and news consumption habits."
