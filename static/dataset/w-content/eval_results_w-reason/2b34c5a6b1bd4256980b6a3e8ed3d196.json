        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the shapeshifter's decision-making process and the twist of realizing the new woman isn't suitable. However, it lacks deeper exploration of the shapeshifter's motivations or the consequences of his actions, which limits its originality. The coherence score is lower due to several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the shapeshifter's interest in the new woman to his decision to eliminate her partner. The narrative jumps quickly from one event to another without smooth transitions, making the flow somewhat disjointed."
