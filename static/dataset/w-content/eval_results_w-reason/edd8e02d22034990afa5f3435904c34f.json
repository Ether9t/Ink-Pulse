        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article introduces some standard ideas with a bit of development, such as the division of the world into Onondaga and Shinto and the use of Mana to rebuild the world. However, it lacks deep or creative expansion beyond the introduction, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt introduction of Steven Avery and the sudden mention of hydrogen bombs without sufficient context or buildup. The narrative feels somewhat disjointed, with sections that don't smoothly connect, impacting the overall flow."
