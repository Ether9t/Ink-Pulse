        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article provides a standard critique of common stereotypes in literature and media, such as the 'evil stepmother,' 'put-upon heroine,' and 'bad dad.' While these ideas are not particularly novel, the article does offer some development by discussing how these stereotypes often appear together and the impact they have on perceptions of family dynamics. This earns it a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured, with a logical progression from one stereotype to the next, and maintains a consistent tone throughout, justifying a score of 4."
