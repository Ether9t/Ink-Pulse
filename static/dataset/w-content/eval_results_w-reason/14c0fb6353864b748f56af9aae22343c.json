        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the responsibilities of extreme sports participants towards their families, such as ensuring financial security and preparing loved ones for potential outcomes. These are not particularly novel insights but are relevant and developed beyond the introduction. The coherence score is 3 because the article generally maintains a logical structure, discussing the emotional and financial implications of extreme sports participation. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing emotional impacts to financial planning, which could be smoother."
