        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by emphasizing the importance of self-discovery and personal growth in school, which is a novel angle beyond traditional academic learning. This focus on self-awareness, goal-setting, and mental health offers a fresh perspective, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because, while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the shift from discussing high school experiences to personal anecdotes about sports and business. These transitions could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
