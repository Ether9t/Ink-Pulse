        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the pursuit of high-risk sports. It discusses the self-serving nature of sports, the inspiration athletes provide, and the subjective perception of danger, which are common themes in discussions about extreme sports. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep exploration beyond these points, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency throughout, with smooth transitions between points, earning a score of 4."
