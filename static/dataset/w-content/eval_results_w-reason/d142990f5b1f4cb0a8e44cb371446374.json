        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that citizens should be generally aware of major events like COVID-19 but not necessarily in-depth about all global issues. It also touches on the psychological impact of consuming negative news and the potential for individuals to effect change through engagement. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the responsibility of staying informed to the impact of negative news. This results in a coherence score of 3."
