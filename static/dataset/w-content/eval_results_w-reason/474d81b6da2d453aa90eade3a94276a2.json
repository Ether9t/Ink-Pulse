        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that staying informed can be achieved through community engagement rather than consuming news media. This is a common perspective but is developed with the argument that news outlets often blur information with commentary, which can deepen political divides. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from discussing the potential negative impacts of news consumption to emphasizing local engagement as an alternative, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
