        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a shallow critique of stereotypical characters, primarily focusing on personal dislike rather than offering new insights or a deeper analysis of the issue. The examples given (Harry Potter, Rey, Abby) are used to illustrate the author's point, but the arguments are not well-developed or particularly novel, resulting in a fragmented presentation of ideas. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and some natural transitions, but there are occasional unevenness and abrupt shifts, particularly when moving from discussing specific characters to broader statements about stereotypes."
