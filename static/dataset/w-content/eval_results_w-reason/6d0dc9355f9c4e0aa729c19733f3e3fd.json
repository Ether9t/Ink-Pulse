        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of stereotypes in media. It discusses the dehumanizing effect of stereotypes and the moral implications of consuming such content, which are common discussions in this context. However, it does offer a slightly novel angle by suggesting that stereotypes are a conscious choice to dehumanize, rather than just lazy writing. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that flows logically from the identification of the problem to the potential actions of calling out creators. The article maintains a consistent tone and logical progression throughout."
