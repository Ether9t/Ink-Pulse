        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that college athletes should be paid due to the revenue they generate and the potential for increased competition among schools. However, these points are not particularly novel and have been widely discussed in the debate over paying college athletes. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the NCAA's profits to the benefits athletes bring to schools. Overall, the article is coherent but lacks deep or creative expansion beyond the introduction."
