        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by introducing a friendly wolf, Anders, who defies the typical 'big bad wolf' stereotype. This fresh perspective on the classic tale contributes to a new idea score of 4. The narrative explores themes of friendship and overcoming prejudice, which are developed beyond the introduction. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with smooth transitions from Anders' initial attempt to befriend the pig to their eventual friendship. However, there are minor moments where the pig's quick change of heart could have been more gradually developed, preventing a perfect score."
