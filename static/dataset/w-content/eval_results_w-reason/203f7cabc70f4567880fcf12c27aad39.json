        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the cost-effectiveness of reading books over audiobooks and the naturalness of reading. However, it lacks novel insights or creative angles beyond these common points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing cost to the naturalness of reading. The article could benefit from a more structured argument and smoother transitions between points."
