        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison to non-athlete students and the potential impact on smaller schools, which are not particularly novel but are relevant to the discussion. The argument about maintaining the 'fun' and passion in college sports is a common perspective but is articulated with some depth. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure, with each point building on the previous one. The transitions between points are smooth, and the overall argument is consistent and well-organized."
