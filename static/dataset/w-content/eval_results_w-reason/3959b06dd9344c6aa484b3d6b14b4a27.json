        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as using screen time to connect with loved ones, learn new skills, or find an escape from pandemic-related stress. These are not particularly novel but are relevant and expanded upon with examples like playing multiplayer games or learning a new language. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It smoothly transitions from discussing the potential negative effects of excessive screen time to suggesting positive uses and finding a healthy balance. The stylistic consistency is maintained throughout, contributing to a well-structured piece."
