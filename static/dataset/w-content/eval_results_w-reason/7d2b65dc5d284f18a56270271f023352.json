        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the preference for reading due to better understanding of the story and characters, cost considerations, and the physical experience of reading. However, these points are not particularly novel or original. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the cost of audiobooks to the experience of reading at the beach. Overall, the article is coherent but lacks a seamless flow."
