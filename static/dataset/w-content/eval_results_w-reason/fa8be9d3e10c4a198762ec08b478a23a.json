        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article provides a basic expansion on the introduction's premise but lacks depth and originality, resulting in a score of 2 for New Idea. It reiterates the concept of a shapeshifter dating the same woman repeatedly without adding significant new insights or creative angles. The narrative about Soeurette's realization and subsequent decision to date a woman is a predictable twist rather than a novel development. For Coherence, the article scores a 2 due to several awkward transitions and a lack of logical structure. The shift from Soeurette's realization to her decision to date Charlotte is abrupt, and the description of their relationship feels disjointed from the rest of the narrative. The article lacks a smooth flow and stylistic consistency, making it feel stitched together rather than a cohesive piece."
