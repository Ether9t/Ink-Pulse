        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the necessity of screens during the pandemic and the potential for new norms of behavior. It highlights the benefits of screens in remote work, online shopping, and education, which are not entirely novel but are relevant and expanded upon. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that progresses logically from the necessity of screens to the need for adaptation and acceptance. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
