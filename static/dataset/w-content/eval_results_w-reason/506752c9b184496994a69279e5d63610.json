        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of technology on dating, such as the prevalence of dating apps leading to less serious relationships and the potential for mistrust due to misrepresentation on social media. These are not particularly novel insights but are developed with some supporting examples. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, with a logical progression from discussing dating apps to social media and then to platforms like Twitch and OnlyFans. However, the transitions between these topics could be smoother, and the tone occasionally shifts from analytical to somewhat alarmist, which affects the overall coherence."
