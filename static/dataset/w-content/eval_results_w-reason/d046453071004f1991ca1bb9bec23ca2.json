        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the opportunity to resolve past issues and the notion of the movie being a transformative experience. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored beyond the introduction. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing the implications of the movie, the potential inaccuracies, and the importance of living in the present. The transitions between these sections are smooth, contributing to a well-structured piece."
