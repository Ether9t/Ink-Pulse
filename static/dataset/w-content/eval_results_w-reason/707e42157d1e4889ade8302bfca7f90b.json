        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, focusing on critical thinking and the scientific method as essential skills for students. While these are important concepts, they are not particularly novel or original, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the importance of thinking skills to the personal impact on the author's life. Overall, the article is coherent but lacks seamless flow and unity."
