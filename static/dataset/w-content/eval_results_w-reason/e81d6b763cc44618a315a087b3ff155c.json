        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on reincarnation by introducing the concept of a 'soul group' and the idea of souls choosing roles in each other's lives to gain diverse experiences. This adds depth beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article is generally well-structured, with a logical progression from reviewing past lives to planning future ones, and it maintains a consistent style. However, some transitions, such as the shift from discussing life lessons to the soul group dynamics, could be smoother, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
