        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, focusing on financial literacy and problem-solving as crucial skills for students. These are not particularly novel concepts, but the article does provide a personal anecdote that adds some depth to the discussion, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the importance of financial skills to problem-solving, supported by personal experiences. The transitions are natural, and the narrative is consistent, though not exceptionally refined."
