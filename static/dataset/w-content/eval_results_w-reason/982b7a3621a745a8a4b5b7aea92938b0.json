        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article provides a standard discussion on stereotypes, particularly focusing on the portrayal of black characters in media. It offers some development beyond the introduction by discussing specific examples like the 'black friend' trope and Hattie McDaniels's character in 'Gone with the Wind.' However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights or angles, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression, with smooth transitions between points. The discussion is consistent in style and tone, making it easy to follow."
