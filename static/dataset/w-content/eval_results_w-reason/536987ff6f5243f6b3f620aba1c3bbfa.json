        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that animals cannot speak for themselves and thus need human advocates, and that there are fewer resources available for animals compared to humans. These points are not particularly novel but are developed with some depth. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from one point to another, maintaining a consistent style throughout."
