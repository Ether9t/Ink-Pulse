        "reason": "The article presents a standard critique of the 'boy-obsessed woman' stereotype, discussing its lack of depth and potential harm in reinforcing real-world stereotypes. While the ideas are not particularly novel, they are developed with some depth, particularly in discussing the impact on women's choices and societal perceptions. The coherence is strong, with a clear structure and logical progression from the critique of the stereotype to its broader implications. The article maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, contributing to its overall clarity and readability."
