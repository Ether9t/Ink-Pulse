        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article provides a personal anecdote about meeting a partner through Tinder, which is a standard idea in the context of technology affecting dating. It doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond the common narrative of finding meaningful relationships through dating apps, hence the idea score of 3. The coherence score is also 3 because while the narrative is generally coherent, it includes a detailed and explicit description of a personal encounter that feels somewhat out of place in the context of discussing the broader impact of technology on dating. This section disrupts the flow and could be seen as an abrupt shift in tone."
