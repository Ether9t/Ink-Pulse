        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that the increased screen time during the pandemic is a minor issue compared to other global and societal challenges. This perspective is developed with examples, but it doesn't offer particularly novel insights, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, comparing screen time concerns with more significant global issues. However, the transitions between examples are somewhat abrupt, and the tone shifts from discussing screen time to global crises without smooth transitions, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
