        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article introduces a novel idea beyond the introduction by exploring the consequences of a fractured moon and the need for planetary evacuation, which is a creative expansion of the initial premise. The concept of the moon's destruction affecting Earth's stability and the subsequent evacuation to another planet adds depth to the narrative. However, the coherence score is slightly lower due to some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from observing rockets to the realization of the moon's destruction and the immediate need for evacuation. While the article maintains a generally logical structure, these transitions could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
