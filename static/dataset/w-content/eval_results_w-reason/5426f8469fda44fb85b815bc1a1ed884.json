        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the geopolitical consequences of the US's isolation, such as the formation of regional collectives and a move towards a one-world government. This adds depth beyond the introduction, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is also strong, with a logical progression from the US's confusion to the explanation provided by other countries. The article maintains a consistent tone and structure, though it could benefit from more detailed exploration of the US's internal changes during isolation, which is why it scores a 4 in coherence."
