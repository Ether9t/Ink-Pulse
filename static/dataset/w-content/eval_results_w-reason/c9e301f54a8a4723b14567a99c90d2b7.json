        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development by introducing a twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story, focusing on the 92nd pig and its house made of depleted uranium. This is a novel angle, but the execution is somewhat predictable as it follows the familiar trope of the wolf trying to trick the pig. The idea of using food to lure the pig is not particularly original, but the specific details of pizza, beer, and ice cream add some creativity. For coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the wolf's frustration to his plan and eventual success. The transitions are natural, and the dialogue between the wolf and the pig helps maintain a consistent tone. However, the ending feels slightly abrupt, which prevents it from achieving a perfect score."
