        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a few ideas, such as the notion that providing free pads and tampons is unfair to male students and the suggestion that financially constrained students should receive aid. However, these ideas are not deeply developed or particularly novel, resulting in a score of 2 for new ideas. The coherence score is 3 because the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are some inconsistencies, such as the abrupt transition from discussing fairness to male students to suggesting government aid, which affects the overall flow."
