        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. It explores the consequences of the drug, such as the green skin and insanity, and the societal collapse due to the 'Lost Generation' aging. However, these ideas are not deeply original or extensively developed, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, discussing the progression from the discovery of side effects to societal collapse. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt mention of large animals preying on the green people, which affects the overall flow. Thus, it receives a coherence score of 3."
