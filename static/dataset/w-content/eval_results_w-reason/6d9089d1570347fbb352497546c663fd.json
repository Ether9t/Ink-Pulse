        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the expansion of social circles through technology and the reduced risk of rejection when using dating apps. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing the benefits of technology in dating, the importance of safety, and the potential for finding meaningful connections. The transitions between these points are smooth, contributing to a well-structured piece."
