        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the stereotype of women as homemakers. It discusses the outdated nature of this stereotype and its potential impact on young girls, which aligns with common discussions on gender roles. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond emphasizing the need for change. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It smoothly transitions from discussing the stereotype to its implications and the desired change in societal norms, though it occasionally reiterates points without adding depth."
