        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of technology on dating. It discusses the limitations of online dating, such as the inability to gauge personality and the risk of catfishing, which are common concerns. However, it does not introduce particularly novel insights beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from discussing the drawbacks of online dating to the limitations of digital communication, and finally to the benefits of technology for maintaining existing relationships."
