        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that animals are more vulnerable and that humans have more complex social interactions, which can obscure empathy. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing empathy to societal views on animals, which affects the flow. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
