        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. The twist that both characters are shapeshifters adds a layer of complexity, but it doesn't deeply explore the implications of this revelation, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. The transitions between Tracy's and Jeff's perspectives are smooth, and the dialogue effectively conveys their emotions and intentions, contributing to a well-structured narrative."
