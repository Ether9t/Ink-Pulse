        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of reading, writing, arithmetic, history, science, and arts as foundational elements of education. It also touches on the role of parents and society in teaching life skills, which adds some depth but is not particularly novel. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from discussing basic educational needs to the roles of different societal institutions. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is logically developed, though not exceptionally refined."
