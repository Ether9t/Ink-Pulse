        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, focusing on self-discovery and social learning as key aspects of school education. While these are not entirely novel concepts, the emphasis on personal growth and understanding one's preferences adds some depth. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from discussing basic learning to personal development. Transitions are smooth, and the article remains stylistically consistent throughout."
