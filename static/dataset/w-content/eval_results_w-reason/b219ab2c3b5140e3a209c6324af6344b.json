        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that screens are now essential for staying connected during the pandemic and that screen time should be balanced with self-care. These are not particularly novel insights but are relevant and developed beyond the introduction. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing the benefits of screen time and the importance of balance in a clear and consistent manner."
