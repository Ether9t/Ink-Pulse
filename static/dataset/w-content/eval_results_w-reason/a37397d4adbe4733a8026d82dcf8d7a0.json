        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that the political system is controlled by a powerful few, which is a common critique. It does provide some development by referencing historical events like the 2000 election and the 2020 election, but these are not particularly novel insights. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the influence of powerful individuals on political outcomes. However, the transitions between examples and the overall argument could be smoother, leading to a coherence score of 3."
