        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a pig seeking revenge for the murder of its parents, which is a common narrative trope. However, it does add some development by incorporating the pig's journey and emotional growth, which gives it a moderate level of originality. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, following the pig's journey logically from the village to the discovery of the photo and the vow for revenge. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the pig's happy life in the village to the discovery of the destroyed village. This results in a coherence score of 3."
