        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article provides a standard idea with some development regarding the benefits of audiobooks, particularly focusing on accessibility for those with vision impairments. It highlights the historical context of audiobooks and their evolution, which adds some depth but doesn't introduce highly original ideas. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure, moving from the historical context to the present benefits of audiobooks, with clear transitions and a consistent style. However, it could be more seamless in integrating the broader implications of audiobooks beyond accessibility."
