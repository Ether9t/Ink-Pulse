        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by exploring the emotional and societal impact of the drug's side effects, as well as the role of the 'Lost Generations' in finding a cure. This provides a standard level of development beyond the introduction, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. The article is generally coherent, with a clear narrative progression from the discovery of the side effects to the eventual development of a cure. The transitions between the emotional impact on the protagonist and the scientific efforts are smooth, justifying a coherence score of 4."
