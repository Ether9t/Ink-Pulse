        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the humorous interaction with the supposed JFK and the twist of Obama pursuing a singing career. However, it doesn't delve deeply into these concepts, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the phone call to the performance at the Kennedy Center. The narrative is mostly coherent but lacks a seamless flow, leading to a coherence score of 3."
