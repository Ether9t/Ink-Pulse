        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the balance between staying informed and avoiding being overwhelmed by news, and the importance of having a trusted news source. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing the individual's choice, the importance of being informed, and the potential consequences of being uninformed. The transitions are smooth, and the article is stylistically consistent."
