        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing the relationship between Rachel and John, including the revelation of John's shapeshifting nature. However, the idea of a shapeshifter repeatedly dating the same person is not deeply explored beyond the initial premise, resulting in a standard development of the concept. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as Rachel's quick acceptance of John's revelation and the sudden resolution of their conflict. This results in a coherence score of 3."
