        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and engages in a conversation about science and evolution with the wolf. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some awkward transitions, such as the sudden shift from discussing evolution to the pandemic without a smooth transition. Additionally, the dialogue between the pig and the wolf could be more polished to enhance the flow."
