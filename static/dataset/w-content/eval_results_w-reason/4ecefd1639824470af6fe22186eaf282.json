        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the perspective of the wolf, who feels discriminated against due to the story of 'The Three Little Pigs.' This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, as it delves into the wolf's legal battle and societal challenges, which are original ideas. The article maintains a well-structured narrative with a logical progression from the wolf's grievances to the courtroom scene, and the resolution of the case. However, there are minor inconsistencies, such as the abrupt mention of the wolf's lawyer's credentials, which slightly disrupts the flow. Overall, the article is both innovative and coherent, warranting scores of 4 in both categories."
