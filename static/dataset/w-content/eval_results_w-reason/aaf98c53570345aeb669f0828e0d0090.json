        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the thrill and excitement being central to defining extreme sports as sports, and the notion of competition and personal challenge. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that logically progresses from defining extreme sports to discussing the elements of thrill, competition, and personal challenge. Transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
