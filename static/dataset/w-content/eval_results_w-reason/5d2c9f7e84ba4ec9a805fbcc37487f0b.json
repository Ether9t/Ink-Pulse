        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard critique of the 'dumb blonde' stereotype, which is a well-known trope. The idea score is 3 because it offers some development on why this stereotype is problematic, such as its sexist undertones and lack of originality, but it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured, with a clear progression of ideas from identifying the stereotype to explaining why it is offensive and overused. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed throughout."
