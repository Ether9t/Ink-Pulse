        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the pig using the internet to research materials and the wolf attempting to counteract this with his own research. However, the concept of using depleted uranium and the twist that it wasn't actually uranium adds a slight novel angle. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some awkward transitions, such as the abrupt mention of Amazon and the unclear sentence 'That would caused the entire home to collapse.' Overall, the article maintains a logical structure but could benefit from smoother transitions and more depth in its ideas."
