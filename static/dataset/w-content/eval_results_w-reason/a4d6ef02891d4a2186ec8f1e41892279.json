        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion of civic duty and the impact of news on personal and societal levels. It discusses the balance between staying informed and focusing on local issues, which is a common perspective. However, it does not introduce particularly novel insights or angles beyond these standard ideas, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains a consistent tone and logical flow, discussing personal experiences and broader societal implications in a cohesive manner, which justifies a score of 4."
