        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on reincarnation by introducing the concept of a cinema where one watches their past and future lives, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The twist that the life was a simulation for educational purposes adds depth and originality, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the shock of death to the realization of the simulation. The transition to the intermission and the explanation of the pamphlet is smooth, though there is a slight abruptness in the revelation of the simulation concept. Overall, the article is well-structured with a natural flow, justifying a coherence score of 4."
