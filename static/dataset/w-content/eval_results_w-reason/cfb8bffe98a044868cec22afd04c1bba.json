        "idea_score": 1,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article does not expand on the unique concept of a shapeshifter dating the same woman repeatedly, which was introduced in the topic. Instead, it focuses on a generic relationship story involving mental health issues, which is unrelated to the shapeshifter theme. Therefore, it scores a 1 for new ideas as it lacks originality beyond the introduction. In terms of coherence, the article is mostly smooth but has several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from relationship issues to the woman's diagnosis and subsequent resolution. The narrative lacks a clear connection to the shapeshifter element, resulting in a coherence score of 2."
