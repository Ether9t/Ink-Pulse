        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as using screen time to connect, learn, and create, which are common suggestions in discussions about screen time. However, it does not introduce particularly novel insights or angles beyond these well-trodden paths, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains a consistent tone and logical flow throughout, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
