        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article provides a standard exploration of the author's relationship with their father, offering some development beyond the introduction by discussing personal anecdotes and feelings. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights or angles, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, but there are moments where the transitions between thoughts and sections feel slightly uneven, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the father's ranking to the author's feelings about their own child. This results in a coherence score of 3."
