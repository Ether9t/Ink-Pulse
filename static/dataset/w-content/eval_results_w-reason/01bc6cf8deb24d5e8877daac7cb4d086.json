        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the immersive experience of reading a physical book and the distraction potential of audiobooks. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing the sensory and experiential aspects of reading versus listening, and the value of disconnecting from technology. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article consistently supports the preference for physical books."
