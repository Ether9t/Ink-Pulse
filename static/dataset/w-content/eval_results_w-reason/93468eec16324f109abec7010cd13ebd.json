        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on the consequences of a drug that grants immortality, focusing on the sensory overload and madness it causes, which is a clear expansion beyond the introduction. This is a strong original idea, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden mention of the remote island and the cocktail solution, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
