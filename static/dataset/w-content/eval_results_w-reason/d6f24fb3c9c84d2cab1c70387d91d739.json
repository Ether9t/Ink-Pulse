        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of technology in facilitating communication and helping shy individuals approach dating. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from one point to the next, maintaining a consistent tone and logical flow, which justifies a coherence score of 4."
