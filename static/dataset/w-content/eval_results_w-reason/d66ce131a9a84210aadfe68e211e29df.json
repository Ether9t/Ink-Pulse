        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of dating apps for shy individuals and the broader range of people one can meet. It also touches on the potential downsides, like superficial judgments based on appearance and the potential for dishonesty. However, these points are relatively common discussions in the context of dating apps, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the benefits to the drawbacks of dating apps. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
