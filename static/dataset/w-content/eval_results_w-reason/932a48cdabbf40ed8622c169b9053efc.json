        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of balance in screen time and the potential negative effects of excessive use on social life and physical health. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from acknowledging the necessity of screens during the pandemic to discussing the importance of balance and the use of screen time trackers. Transitions are smooth, and the article is stylistically consistent."
