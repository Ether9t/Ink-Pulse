        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. It introduces 'The Madness' as a side effect of the immortality drug, which is a logical extension of the introduction's premise. The concept of using a new drug to reverse the effects and the method of distribution via 'bombs' and planes adds some depth, but these ideas are not deeply explored or particularly novel. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, with a clear narrative progression from the discovery of side effects to the government's response. However, the transition from the problem to the solution is somewhat abrupt, and the article could benefit from more detailed exploration of the consequences and ethical considerations of the government's actions."
