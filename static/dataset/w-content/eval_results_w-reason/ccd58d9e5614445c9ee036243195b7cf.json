        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the notion that the U.S. was the only country to follow the isolation agreement due to its nuclear capabilities and fear of other nations. However, it lacks depth and originality, as it primarily reiterates the introduction's premise without offering significant new insights. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several awkward transitions and lacks a smooth flow. For instance, the abrupt shift from discussing the U.S.'s nuclear power to the idea of karma and alliances feels disjointed. The article could benefit from a more structured progression and clearer connections between ideas."
