        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of JFK faking his death to work on secret technology. However, it doesn't delve deeply into the implications or explore the concept in a particularly novel way, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from skepticism to engagement with the supposed JFK. The narrative flow is mostly logical, but the resolution feels somewhat abrupt and lacks depth, leading to a coherence score of 3."
