        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article provides some ideas about the impact of technology on society, such as increased connectivity and changes in socialization, but these are fairly standard observations and lack depth or originality, resulting in a score of 2 for new ideas. The coherence score is 3 because the article generally maintains a logical structure, discussing technology's impact on communication and learning from past mistakes, but it occasionally lacks smooth transitions between points, such as the abrupt shift from discussing children's socialization to global diplomacy."
