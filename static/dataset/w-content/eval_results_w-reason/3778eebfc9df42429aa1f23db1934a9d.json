        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, focusing on academic knowledge and social skills as important things students should learn in school. These are common themes in educational discussions, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from discussing academic knowledge to social skills, and concludes by tying these elements together, which justifies a coherence score of 4. The mention of honesty as a personal takeaway adds a slight personal touch but does not significantly elevate the originality of the ideas presented."
