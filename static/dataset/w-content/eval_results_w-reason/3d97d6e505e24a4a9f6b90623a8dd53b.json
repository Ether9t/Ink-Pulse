        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a secret club of former U.S. Presidents who continue to work on undisclosed missions, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The inclusion of JFK, who is historically deceased, adds an intriguing twist, suggesting a deeper conspiracy or alternate reality. However, the coherence score is slightly lower due to some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden appearance of an alien spaceship and the transformation of Obama into an alien. These elements, while imaginative, could have been integrated more smoothly to enhance the narrative flow."
