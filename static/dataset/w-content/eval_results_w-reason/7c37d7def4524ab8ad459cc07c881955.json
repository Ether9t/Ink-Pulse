        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it explores the protagonist's newfound power over bees and their decision to use this power for revenge. This is a logical extension of the introduction but lacks deeper exploration or multiple original ideas, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, following a clear sequence of events from the protagonist's initial fear to their decision to exact revenge. However, the transition from the protagonist's disbelief to acceptance of their power is somewhat abrupt, and the resolution with Soeurette feels rushed, leading to a coherence score of 3."
