        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed in a democracy and the reference to ancient Greek standards. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from the importance of being informed to the consequences of ignorance. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed, leading to a well-structured piece."
