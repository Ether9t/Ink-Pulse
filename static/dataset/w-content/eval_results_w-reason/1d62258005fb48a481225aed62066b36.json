        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents some standard ideas about the risks of excessive screen time, such as links to depression and anxiety, but these are not particularly novel insights beyond what is commonly known. The repeated emphasis on WHO recommendations and the behavior of social media influencers lacks depth and originality, resulting in a shallow exploration of the topic. Therefore, the idea score is 2. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, listing WHO recommendations and contrasting them with influencer behavior. However, the repetitive nature of the examples and the abrupt shift to the call for action at the end create some unevenness, leading to a coherence score of 3."
