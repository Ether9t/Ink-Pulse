        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of technology in maintaining long-distance relationships and easing the initial stages of dating through apps. It also touches on the role of technology in uncovering infidelity, which adds a slightly novel angle. However, these ideas are not deeply original or groundbreaking, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from discussing communication benefits to dating apps and then to the role of technology in relationship fidelity. The transitions are natural, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
