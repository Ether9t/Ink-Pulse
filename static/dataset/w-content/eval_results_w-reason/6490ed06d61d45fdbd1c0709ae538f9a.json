        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that pursuing extreme sports is not selfish if it doesn't harm others and the emphasis on teamwork in mountain climbing. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and progression of ideas, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing teamwork to the broader concept of risk-taking in daily life. Overall, the article is coherent but could benefit from more refined transitions and deeper exploration of new ideas."
