        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard critique of stereotypical characters, specifically focusing on Steve Urkel as an example. The idea score is a 3 because it offers some development on the topic by discussing the impact of stereotypes on real-life perceptions and behaviors, but it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights. The coherence score is also a 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure, discussing the negative aspects of stereotypes and comparing different shows. However, the transitions between points could be smoother, and the argument could be more cohesively developed."
