        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing the resistance's efforts to train and organize against the aliens, which is a standard development of the initial premise. The introduction of a secretive group of powerful Mana wielders adds a slight twist, but it is not deeply explored, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from Lia's leadership to the final battle. The transitions between the discovery of powers, the formation of the resistance, and the alliance with the secretive group are smooth, though the article could benefit from more stylistic refinement to achieve a perfect score."
