        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard cautionary tale about the risks of rushing medical treatments without thorough testing, which is a well-trodden theme. It lacks new insights or novel angles beyond the introduction, resulting in a score of 2 for New Idea. The article is generally coherent, with a clear message about the importance of caution in medication development. However, it occasionally feels repetitive and lacks depth in exploring the consequences of the drug's side effects, leading to a coherence score of 3."
