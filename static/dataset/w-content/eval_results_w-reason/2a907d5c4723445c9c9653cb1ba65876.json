        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of rebuilding society with teams of specialists, which is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel, earning it a score of 3 for new ideas. The introduction of a hidden group adds some intrigue but is not deeply explored. For coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, describing the rebuilding process and the encounter with the hidden group. However, the transition to the hidden group and their integration feels somewhat abrupt and lacks depth, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
