        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a dystopian society with a dictator and civil unrest, which is a common theme in speculative fiction. However, it does expand on the introduction by detailing the internal political situation in the US and the global reaction, which adds some depth. Thus, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, moving from the internal chaos in the US to the global reaction. However, the transition to the world building a wall around the US feels abrupt and lacks detailed explanation, leading to a coherence score of 3."
