        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the emotional journey of the narrator as they grapple with the concept of ranking dads. It doesn't introduce multiple strong original ideas but does explore the personal impact of the ranking system, which is a logical extension of the introduction. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured narrative that follows the protagonist's curiosity and eventual realization. The transitions between the protagonist's observations and reflections are smooth, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout."
