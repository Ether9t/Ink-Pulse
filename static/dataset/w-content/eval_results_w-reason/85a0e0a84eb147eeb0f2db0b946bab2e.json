        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea about the 'dumb blonde' stereotype, which is a well-known topic. It does provide some development by discussing the potential impacts on self-esteem and workplace dynamics, but these insights are not particularly novel. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, discussing the stereotype's history and its effects. However, it occasionally lacks smooth transitions, such as jumping from personal anecdotes to broader societal impacts without clear linkage. Thus, it also scores a 3 for coherence."
