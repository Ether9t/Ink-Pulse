        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed to make better decisions and the role of news in enabling active participation in government. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure, with clear progression from the importance of being informed to the implications for civic engagement. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed throughout."
