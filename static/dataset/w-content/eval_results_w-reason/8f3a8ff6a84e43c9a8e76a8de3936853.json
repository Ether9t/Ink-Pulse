        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the suggestion to install dispensers in girls' bathrooms and locker rooms, and the argument that providing free pads and tampons would reduce period shaming and embarrassment. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the benefits to expressing surprise and disturbance over the controversy. The article could benefit from a more structured progression and smoother transitions between ideas."
