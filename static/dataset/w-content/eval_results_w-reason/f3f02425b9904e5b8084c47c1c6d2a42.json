        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the 92nd little pig's story, which diverges from the traditional tale of the three little pigs. It introduces the idea of the pig building a house out of depleted uranium and forming an unexpected friendship with the wolf, who is typically an antagonist. This fresh perspective on the wolf's character, revealing his struggle with depression and desire for change, adds depth and originality, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. The article is well-structured, with a clear progression from the pig's initial indifference to the wolf, to their conversation, and finally to their joint community work. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, justifying a coherence score of 4."
