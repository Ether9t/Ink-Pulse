        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed for democratic participation and the challenges posed by biased media and social media algorithms. These are not particularly novel insights but are relevant to the topic. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from the importance of being informed to the issues with current news consumption and the conclusion about the role of citizens. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed."
