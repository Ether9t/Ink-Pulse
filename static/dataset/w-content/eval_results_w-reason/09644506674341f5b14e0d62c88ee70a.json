        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that schools should focus on education and not be responsible for providing feminine products. It also compares the provision of pads and tampons to insulin for diabetic students, which is a somewhat novel angle. However, the ideas are not particularly original or deeply explored, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing school budgets to student dependency. This results in a coherence score of 3."
