        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that humans are seen as responsible for their own suffering while animals are viewed as innocent. It also touches on the idea that humans, despite their capabilities, can be trapped by circumstances, which adds some depth. However, these ideas are not particularly novel, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It maintains a logical flow from discussing why people empathize more with animals to arguing for equal empathy towards helpless humans, though it could benefit from more seamless transitions in a few places."
