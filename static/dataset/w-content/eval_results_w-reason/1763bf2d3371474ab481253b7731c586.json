        "idea_score": 5,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents multiple strong original ideas, such as the pig building a house out of depleted uranium and the wolf's increasingly desperate and creative attempts to destroy it, including using a B2 Spirit stealth bomber and attempting to acquire a nuclear device. These elements contribute to a highly creative and humorous expansion beyond the introduction, warranting a high idea score of 5. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally smooth and logical progression, detailing the wolf's escalating efforts and the pig's defenses. However, there are minor instances where the transitions between the wolf's attempts could be more seamless, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
