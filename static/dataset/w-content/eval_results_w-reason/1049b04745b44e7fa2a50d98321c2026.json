        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the influence of media on empathy towards animals and the visibility of tourists versus animals. These are not particularly novel but are developed with some reasoning. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and progression from discussing media influence to the moral stance on prioritizing human suffering. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing media influence to the moral argument without a clear connection."
