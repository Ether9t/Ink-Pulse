        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the transformation into a bee-human hybrid and the revelation of being a queen bee. However, it lacks depth and creativity beyond the initial concept, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, particularly the abrupt shift from the bee transformation to the drug-induced hallucination explanation. The narrative feels disjointed, and the ending is jarring, impacting the overall flow and unity."
