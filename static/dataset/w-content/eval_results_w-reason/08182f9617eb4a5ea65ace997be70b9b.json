        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents some standard ideas with moderate development, such as limiting athlete pay and ensuring they receive royalties, which are not entirely novel but offer a slightly different perspective. The suggestion to protect athletes similarly to child models is a somewhat fresh angle. However, the article lacks multiple strong original ideas, thus receiving a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing various aspects of athlete compensation and conduct. However, it occasionally lacks smooth transitions between points, such as jumping from athlete pay to coach conduct without a clear link, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
