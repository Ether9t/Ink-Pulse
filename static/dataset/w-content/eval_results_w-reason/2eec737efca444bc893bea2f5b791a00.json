        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that extreme sports should be considered hobbies rather than competitive sports to reduce risk, which is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel. The suggestion to remove the competitive aspect to enhance safety is a reasonable point, but it lacks depth and exploration of potential counterarguments or broader implications. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, with a clear structure and logical progression from the argument that extreme sports are dangerous to the conclusion that they should not be considered sports. However, the transitions between points could be smoother, and the argument could be more thoroughly developed to enhance coherence."
