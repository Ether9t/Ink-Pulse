        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig with a Ph.D. in nuclear physics who builds a house out of depleted uranium. This is a creative and humorous angle, earning a high score for new ideas. The dialogue between Clyde and the wolf adds depth and humor, further contributing to the originality. However, the idea of selling the house to the wolf as a form of revenge is somewhat predictable, preventing a perfect score. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with clear transitions between the pig's conversation with the wolf and his internal monologue. The tone is consistent, and the story flows well, though there are minor moments where the dialogue could be smoother, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the house to the wolf's interest in buying it."
