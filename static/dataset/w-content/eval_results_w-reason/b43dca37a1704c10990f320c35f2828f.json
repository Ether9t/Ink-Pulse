        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of watching one's next life unfold in a theater with previous reincarnations, which is an interesting expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of telepathic communication among reincarnations adds depth and originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is well-maintained with a logical progression from confusion to understanding, and the transitions are mostly smooth, though there are minor areas where the flow could be slightly improved, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
