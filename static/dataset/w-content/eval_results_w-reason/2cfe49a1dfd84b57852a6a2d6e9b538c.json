        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that the education system should focus more on teaching trades and practical skills, which is a common critique. It does not introduce highly original ideas but does develop the argument with some depth, discussing the inefficiency of the current system and the mismatch between education and employability. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the perceived shortcomings of the education system and the need for practical skills. However, it occasionally lacks smooth transitions, particularly when shifting from personal reflection to broader societal critique, which affects the flow. Thus, it scores a 3 for coherence."
