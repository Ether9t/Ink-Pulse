        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the 'dumb blonde' stereotype. It discusses the negative impact of this stereotype on women's portrayal in media and the importance of strong female characters, which are common arguments in discussions about stereotypes. However, it does not introduce any particularly novel insights or angles beyond these points, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains a consistent tone and logical flow from one point to the next, justifying a score of 4 for coherence."
