        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of the elderly turning into zombies and the unique twist of the 85-year-olds who did not take the drug being immune and able to reverse the zombie condition. However, it lacks depth and originality beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article has a mostly smooth narrative but suffers from several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt mention of the previous pandemic and the sudden introduction of the immune group without much context or explanation. This results in a coherence score of 2."
