        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the necessity of providing pads and tampons in schools due to period poverty and the comparison to other essential items like Band-Aids. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond the introduction. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from the problem (lack of access to hygiene products) to the solution (schools providing them). The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed, making it well-structured overall."
