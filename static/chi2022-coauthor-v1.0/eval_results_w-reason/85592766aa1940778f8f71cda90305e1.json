        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative of a young mage's journey, which is reminiscent of existing stories like Harry Potter. The idea of a powerful mage protagonist and an evil rival is not particularly novel, and the plot developments, such as the ultimatum and the trick to turn Koru into a plant, are somewhat predictable. Therefore, the idea score is 2 for its shallow expansion beyond the introduction. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, following Riku's growth and conflict with Koru. However, the transitions between Riku's abilities, his school life, and the final confrontation with Koru could be smoother, leading to a coherence score of 3."
