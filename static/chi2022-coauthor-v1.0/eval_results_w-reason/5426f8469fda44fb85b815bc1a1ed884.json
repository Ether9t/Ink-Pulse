        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the consequences of the U.S. being the only nation to adhere to the isolation agreement, which is a clear expansion beyond the introduction. It introduces the concept of regional collectives and a global political structure, which are new insights. However, it could delve deeper into the implications of these changes. The coherence is strong, with a logical progression from the U.S.'s confusion to the explanation provided by other countries. The article maintains a consistent tone and style, though it could benefit from more detailed transitions between the U.S.'s reaction and the global changes."
