        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the perspective of the wolf, who feels discriminated against due to the story of the three little pigs. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a coherent structure, with a logical progression from the wolf's realization of discrimination to the legal proceedings and the judge's decision. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the style is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
