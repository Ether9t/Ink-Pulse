        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on reincarnation by visualizing past lives as a cinema experience, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. It explores the diversity of past lives and raises philosophical questions about identity, morality, and the nature of reincarnation, contributing clear new insights. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured narrative that smoothly transitions from observing the different incarnations to pondering existential questions. However, the ending could have been more conclusive, which slightly affects the coherence score."
