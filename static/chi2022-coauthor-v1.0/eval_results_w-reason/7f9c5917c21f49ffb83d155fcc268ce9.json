        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the long-term side effects of the immortality drug, specifically the regression to a childlike state, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The idea of a society where young people care for 'grown babies' adds depth and originality, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, detailing the government's response and societal impact. However, the transition to the solution of hiring young caretakers could be smoother, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
