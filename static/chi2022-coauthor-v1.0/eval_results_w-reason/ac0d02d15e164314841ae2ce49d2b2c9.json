        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. The concept of a mysterious voice guiding the protagonist to reconsider her approach to love adds a slight twist, but it doesn't significantly expand on the shapeshifter theme introduced. The idea of self-improvement and finding true love is a common trope, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, with a clear sequence of events from the protagonist preparing for the date to her decision to cancel it. However, the transition from the mysterious voice to her decision feels somewhat abrupt, and the article could benefit from smoother transitions and more stylistic consistency, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
