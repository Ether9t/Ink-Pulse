        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the US becoming a neutral power like Switzerland and thriving economically due to its isolation. However, it doesn't delve deeply into new or original insights beyond the introduction. The idea that the US is the only superpower left and other countries can't afford neutrality due to resource constraints is somewhat predictable. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression. It smoothly transitions from discussing the US's economic success to its global position and potential for influence, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
