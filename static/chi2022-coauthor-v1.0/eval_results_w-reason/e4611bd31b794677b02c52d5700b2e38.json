        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel concept of reincarnation where past lives gather to watch a documentary of the next life, which is an original and creative expansion beyond the introduction. The dialogue between the protagonist and his past incarnation adds depth to the idea, exploring themes of missed opportunities and the symbolism of the 'white rabbit.' This earns a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with smooth transitions between the protagonist's interactions and reflections. The narrative is consistent and well-paced, though the ending could have been more conclusive. Thus, it receives a coherence score of 4."
