        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a fragmented and shallow expansion of the introduction's premise. The idea of Obama being contacted by JFK and subsequently trapped is intriguing but not developed with depth or originality beyond the initial setup. The narrative quickly devolves into a series of disjointed events, such as the sudden appearance of a 'man in black' and the abrupt ending with a cyanide pill, which lack creative expansion or insight. Coherence is also lacking, as the story transitions awkwardly from one event to another without logical progression or explanation, such as the immediate jump from being blinded to being in a facility. The narrative feels rushed and stitched together, resulting in a disjointed reading experience."
