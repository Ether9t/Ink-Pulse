        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the twist that the pigs' homes were not actually made of depleted uranium, which adds a layer of creativity. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep expansion beyond the introduction. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the wolf's initial frustration to his failed attempt with fireworks. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt revelation of the pigs' secret, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
