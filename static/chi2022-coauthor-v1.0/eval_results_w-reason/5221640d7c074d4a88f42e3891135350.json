        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and uses a rocket-propelled grenade, which is a creative and humorous expansion beyond the introduction. This earns it a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the story maintains a generally consistent tone and logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the Big Bad Elephant gang and the quick escalation to using a rocket-propelled grenade, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
