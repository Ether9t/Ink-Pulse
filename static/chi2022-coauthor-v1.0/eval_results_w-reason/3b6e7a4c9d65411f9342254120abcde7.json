        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by introducing the concept of using depleted uranium containers as building materials, which is an original and creative idea beyond the introduction. The collaboration between the wolf and the pig to recycle and repurpose these materials adds depth to the narrative, showcasing a unique twist on the traditional pig and wolf story. The article is well-structured, with a clear progression from the pig's choice of material to the benefits and outcomes of this decision. The transitions between the pig's decision-making process, the wolf's involvement, and the final outcome are smooth, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout. However, the article could have explored the implications of using such materials in more depth to achieve a perfect score in both categories."
