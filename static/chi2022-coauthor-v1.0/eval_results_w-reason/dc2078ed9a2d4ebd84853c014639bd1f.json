        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. It explores the consequences of the immortality drug's failure and the societal backlash against the researchers, which adds some depth to the initial premise. However, it doesn't introduce multiple strong original ideas or deeply expand on the topic. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the discovery of the side effects to the societal reaction. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the researchers' greed to the life lesson for society, which affects the overall flow."
