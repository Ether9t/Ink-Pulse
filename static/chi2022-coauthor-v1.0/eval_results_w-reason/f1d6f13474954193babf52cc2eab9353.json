        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard development of the introduction's premise, focusing on the shapeshifter's attempts to win the woman's heart. The idea score is a 3 because while it expands on the introduction by detailing David's strategy and the eventual revelation, it doesn't introduce significantly novel concepts beyond the initial setup. The coherence score is also a 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are moments where the narrative could be smoother, such as the abrupt transition from the date to the confrontation. Overall, the article is coherent but lacks deeper exploration or unexpected twists."
