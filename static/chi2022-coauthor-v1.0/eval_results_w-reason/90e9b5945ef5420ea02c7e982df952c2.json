        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing depleted uranium as a building material and the wolf's attempts to breach it with explosives. This adds a creative angle, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. However, the narrative doesn't deeply explore these concepts beyond the initial setup, limiting the depth of originality. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, with a clear sequence of events. However, the transition from the wolf's failed attempts to the sudden sharing of sandwiches and the pig's subsequent demise feels abrupt and slightly disjointed, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
