        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard expansion of the introduction's premise, focusing on the societal consequences of immortality and the conflict between generations. It introduces the idea of a village for the Lost Generations and a war between the older and younger generations, which adds some depth but remains within expected narrative developments. The coherence is generally maintained, but the article lacks a seamless flow, with some abrupt transitions between the societal impacts and Adam's personal story. The narrative could benefit from more detailed exploration of the psychological and societal dynamics introduced."
