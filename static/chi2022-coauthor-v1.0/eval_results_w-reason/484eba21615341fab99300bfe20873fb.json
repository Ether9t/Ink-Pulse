        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the plan to use a clone of Matt Damon to trick the aliens. This adds a layer of complexity beyond the introduction, but it doesn't delve deeply into novel insights or creative expansions. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical sequence of events, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt mention of the aliens' plan to swap the real Matt Damon with the clone. Overall, the article maintains a consistent narrative but lacks depth in both originality and seamless flow."
