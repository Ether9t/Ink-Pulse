        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the twist of JFK's staged death and the secretive witness protection program. However, it doesn't delve deeply into these concepts or offer multiple strong original ideas, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with clear transitions from Obama's curiosity to the phone call and the subsequent explanation by 'JFK'. The narrative flows well, though the ending with the dream sequence is somewhat predictable."
