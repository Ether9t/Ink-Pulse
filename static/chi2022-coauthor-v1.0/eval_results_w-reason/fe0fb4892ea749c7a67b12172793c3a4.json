        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a humorous and somewhat novel take on the recurring theme of Matt Damon being rescued, adding a twist with the alien abduction and the confusion of multiple Matt Damons. This provides a standard idea with some development, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. However, the resolution with Ben Affleck shooting both Matt Damons is abrupt and lacks depth, preventing a higher score. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative with a clear sequence of events, but the abrupt ending and the lack of explanation for the duplicate items and Matt Damons create some unevenness, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
