        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by exploring the concept of reincarnation through the lens of watching one's future life unfold in a cinema, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The twist of discovering connections between past and future lives, such as the protagonist's relationship with Soeurette and Harper, adds depth and originality to the narrative. However, the coherence score is slightly lower due to some abrupt transitions, particularly when shifting from Matty's realization of Soeurette's infidelity to his subsequent life changes. While the overall structure is generally coherent, there are moments where the narrative could flow more smoothly, such as the transition from Matty's heartbreak to his new life with Vivian."
