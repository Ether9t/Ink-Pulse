        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing modern elements like the internet and depleted uranium, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The idea of the wolf using the internet to counter the pig's strategy is a fresh angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the wolf's sudden decision to steal a firetruck, which could have been more smoothly integrated into the narrative."
