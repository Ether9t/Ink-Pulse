        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on the concept of reincarnation by framing it as a cinematic experience where one watches their next life unfold. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The narrative explores the protagonist's choice of a private box seat, their reactions to the film, and the philosophical question posed at the end, which adds depth to the concept. For coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the protagonist's anticipation to the unfolding of the film and the philosophical conclusion. The transitions between the protagonist's observations and interactions are smooth, though there is a slight abruptness in the transition from the film's end to the philosophical question, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
