        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by introducing the concept of a counterdrug that reverses the sterilization effects but causes rapid aging, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This adds depth to the narrative by exploring the social and personal consequences of such a solution, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 4, as the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the discovery of the side effects to the development and impact of the counterdrug. The transitions between the emotional responses of the affected individuals and the societal implications are generally smooth, though there are minor instances where the narrative could be more tightly woven."
