        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative with some development beyond the introduction. The idea of a bee servant is intriguing, but the article quickly shifts to a more conventional story about an allergic reaction and its aftermath. The narrative does not deeply explore the initial novel concept of the bee's servitude, which limits the originality score to a 3. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the bee sting incident to the hospital scene and the subsequent actions taken by the mother. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone, earning a coherence score of 4."
