        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the shapeshifter's plan to turn the woman into a shapeshifter herself, which adds a new angle to the story. However, it lacks depth and creativity beyond this point, as the plot quickly resolves with an unexpected and abrupt ending involving the cat and the lion. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the witch and the cat's transformation into a lion, which disrupts the flow and makes the narrative feel disjointed."
