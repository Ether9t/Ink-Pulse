        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a modern twist on reincarnation where past lives vote on the future actions of the new life, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This concept of collective decision-making and its consequences is an original angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden decision to make a pact with the devil, which feels rushed and not fully developed. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed exploration of the consequences of the voting system."
