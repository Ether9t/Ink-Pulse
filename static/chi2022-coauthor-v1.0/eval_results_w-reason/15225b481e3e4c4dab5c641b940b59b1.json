        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on reincarnation by using the metaphor of a cinema to explore potential past and future lives. It introduces the unique concept of watching previews of lives that could have been, which adds depth to the reincarnation theme. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure by transitioning smoothly from one preview to the next, each building on the theme of choices affecting reincarnation outcomes. The progression from a fly to a dog to a powerful being is clear and natural, justifying a coherence score of 4."
