        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a shallow exploration of the consequences of the United States' decision to remain isolated or re-engage with the world. The idea score is 2 because it primarily reiterates the introduction's premise without offering significant new insights or creative expansions. The decision to stay isolated is presented as a straightforward choice without exploring potential complexities or novel angles. The coherence score is 3 as the article maintains a generally logical structure, but the transitions between the United States' decisions and their outcomes are somewhat abrupt and lack depth. The narrative is consistent but lacks a deeper exploration of the implications of each decision."
