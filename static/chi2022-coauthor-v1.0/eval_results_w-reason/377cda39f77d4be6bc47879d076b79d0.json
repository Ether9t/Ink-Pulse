        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a post-apocalyptic world where magic resurfaces due to a reduced human population. The concept of 'chosen' and 'unchosen' adds a layer of societal structure, but it is not deeply explored or particularly novel, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the reawakening of magic to societal decisions about reproduction. However, the transition to the concept of pets for the 'unchosen' feels abrupt and underdeveloped, leading to a coherence score of 3."
