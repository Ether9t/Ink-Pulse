        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of revisiting and editing one's life as if it were a film, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of altering the love story and the ending to create a more fulfilling narrative adds depth and originality, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the realization of the need for change to the execution of those changes and the final viewing of the 'New Film.' The transitions between the Main Character's actions and the audience's reactions are smooth, though there are minor areas where the narrative could be more tightly woven, justifying a coherence score of 4."
