        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on a rescue mission to save Matt Damon from aliens. While the concept of a stealth agent infiltrating an alien base is not particularly novel, the narrative does expand on the introduction by detailing the mission and the agent's capabilities. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from the planning of the mission to its execution and conclusion. The transitions between sections are smooth, and the style remains consistent throughout, contributing to a well-structured narrative."
