        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and imaginative scenario where JFK faked his assassination and is now recruiting Obama to take down the Illuminati. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the narrative is generally coherent, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from disbelief to acceptance of JFK's identity and the quick decision to decline the offer. These transitions could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
