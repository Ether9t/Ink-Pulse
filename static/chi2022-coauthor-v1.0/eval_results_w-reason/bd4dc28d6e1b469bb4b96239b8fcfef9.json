        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the introduction with the concept of aliens misunderstanding movies and negotiating with humans to ensure their secrecy. This is a creative twist on the typical 'rescue Matt Damon' narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is also strong, with a logical progression from Matt's abduction to the negotiation and resolution. The article maintains a consistent tone and style, though the transition from the alien's reasoning to the negotiation could be smoother, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
