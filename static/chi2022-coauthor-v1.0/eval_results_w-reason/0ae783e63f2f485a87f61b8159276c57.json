        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it explores the concept of a shapeshifter trying to perfect himself to win a woman's heart, which is a logical extension of the introduction. However, the twist of the shapeshifter eating the woman and deciding to pursue love as a woman is somewhat novel, though not deeply explored. The coherence score is lower due to the abrupt and jarring transition from the engagement to the shapeshifter revealing his true form and eating her. This shift feels sudden and disrupts the narrative flow, making the article feel disjointed in parts."
