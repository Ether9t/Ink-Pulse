        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the notion of a secret mission involving Obama and JFK, and the concept of a 'new White House' and the need to destroy the old one. However, it lacks depth and originality beyond the initial setup. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the phone call to JFK's sudden appearance and the quick decision to blow up the White House without much explanation. The narrative maintains a logical structure but could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed development."
