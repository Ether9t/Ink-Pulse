        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the shapeshifter's realization that his approach to dating is flawed. It introduces the concept of shapeshifters having mentors and the internal conflict of the protagonist, which adds some depth but doesn't significantly expand beyond the introduction. The coherence is strong, with a clear structure and logical progression from Bill's initial thoughts to his conversation with Ted and eventual realization. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone throughout."
