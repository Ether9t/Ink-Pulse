        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of the United States transitioning from a superpower to a humble, spiritually-focused nation, which is a clear expansion beyond the introduction. This transformation into a place for religious solace and the shift in global dynamics are original angles, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, particularly in the shift from technological competition to spiritual growth, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
