        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a secret society controlling the world, which is a common conspiracy theory. However, it adds a novel twist by involving past presidents and the transformation into lizard people, which provides some creative expansion beyond the introduction. Thus, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article has a basic logical structure but suffers from abrupt transitions, such as the sudden decision to crash the economy and the introduction of the virus to turn people into lizards. These shifts make the narrative feel somewhat disjointed, resulting in a coherence score of 2."
