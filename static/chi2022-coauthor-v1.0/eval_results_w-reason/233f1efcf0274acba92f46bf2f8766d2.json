        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of a human being perceived as a bee queen by actual bees, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of leading bees against humans adds a unique twist, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is well-maintained with a logical progression from the initial encounter with the bee to the realization of the protagonist's supposed role. The narrative flows naturally, with only minor unevenness in the transition from the dream sequence to the real-world encounter, justifying a coherence score of 4."
