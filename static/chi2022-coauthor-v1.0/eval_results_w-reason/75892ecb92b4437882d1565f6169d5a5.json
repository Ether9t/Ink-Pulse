        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by blending real-life figures like Barack Obama with fictional elements from Twin Peaks, creating an intriguing narrative that extends beyond the introduction. The concept of Obama being tasked with solving a murder mystery in a city that is both old and futuristic is a creative expansion. However, the coherence score is slightly lower because while the narrative is generally coherent, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden teleportation to the warehouse and the immediate introduction of Agent Cooper, which could have been smoother. Overall, the article maintains a logical structure but could benefit from more natural transitions."
