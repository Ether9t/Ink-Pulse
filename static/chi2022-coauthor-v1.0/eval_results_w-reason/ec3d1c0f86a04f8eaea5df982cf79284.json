        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 1,
        "reason": "The article presents fragmented and shallow ideas, such as the bee's identity confusion and its reluctance to work, which do not significantly expand on the introduction. The narrative lacks depth and originality, resulting in a low idea score. Coherence is minimal, with abrupt shifts in the bee's identity and purpose, leading to a disjointed reading experience. The article feels stitched together with little logical progression or stylistic consistency."
