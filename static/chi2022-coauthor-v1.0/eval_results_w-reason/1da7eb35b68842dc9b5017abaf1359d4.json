        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard development of the initial concept, exploring the consequences of the ranking system and the government's response. The idea of a government-mandated ranking system and its repeal, followed by a tax credit as an apology, adds some depth beyond the introduction, but it remains within a predictable narrative arc. Thus, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, moving from the problem to the resolution, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the tax credit without much lead-up. This results in a coherence score of 3."
