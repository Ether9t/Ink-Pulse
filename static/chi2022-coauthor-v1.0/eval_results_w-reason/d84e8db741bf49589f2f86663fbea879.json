While the idea of reincarnation is not new, the specific angle of becoming a pet to provide love and support adds a layer of emotional depth, earning it a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4, as the article maintains a well-structured narrative with a clear progression from disappointment to contentment.
