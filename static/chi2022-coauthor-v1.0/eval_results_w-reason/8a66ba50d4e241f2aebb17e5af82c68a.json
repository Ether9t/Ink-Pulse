        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. The twist of the woman knowing about the shapeshifter and her intentions adds a layer of complexity, but it doesn't delve deeply into new insights or novel angles, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, but there are some abrupt transitions, particularly when the woman reveals her knowledge and the subsequent shift to her darker intentions. This results in a coherence score of 3."
