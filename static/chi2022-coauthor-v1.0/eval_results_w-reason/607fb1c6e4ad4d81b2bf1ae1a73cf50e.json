        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of invisibility as a latent human ability triggered by fear, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction's mention of mana reawakening. This adds depth to the concept of mana and its effects on humans, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the narrative is generally coherent, there are some awkward transitions, such as the sudden introduction of Mary and the explanation of invisibility. The story progresses logically but could benefit from smoother transitions and more consistent stylistic elements."
