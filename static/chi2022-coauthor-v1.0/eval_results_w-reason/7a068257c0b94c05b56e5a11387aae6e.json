        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a resistance movement led by a determined individual, which is a common trope in post-apocalyptic or dystopian narratives. The concept of using local knowledge to fight back against occupiers is not particularly novel, but it is developed with some detail, such as the recruitment of former military personnel. Therefore, it earns a score of 3 for idea. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following John's journey from forming a resistance to launching successful attacks. However, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden success of the resistance without much explanation of the challenges faced, which affects the flow. Thus, it receives a coherence score of 3."
