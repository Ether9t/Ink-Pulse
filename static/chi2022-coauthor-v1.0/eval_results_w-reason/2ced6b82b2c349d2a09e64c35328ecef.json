        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a strained father-child relationship, which is a common theme. It does not introduce any particularly novel insights beyond the introduction, but it does develop the personal narrative of the author's disappointment and longing for a better relationship with her father. This earns it a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, following the author's reflections and experiences with her father. However, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shift from discussing the father's ranking to the author's feelings about her son's milestones, which slightly disrupts the flow. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
