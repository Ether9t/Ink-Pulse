        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig with a Ph.D. in nuclear physics who builds a house out of depleted uranium. This is a creative and humorous angle, earning a high score for new ideas. The dialogue between Clyde and the wolf adds depth and humor, further contributing to the originality. However, the idea of the wolf buying the house and the pig's ulterior motive is somewhat predictable, preventing a perfect score. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with clear transitions between the pig's conversation with the wolf and the resolution of the story. The tone is consistent, and the narrative flows well, though there are minor moments where the dialogue could be smoother. Overall, the article is well-structured and engaging."
