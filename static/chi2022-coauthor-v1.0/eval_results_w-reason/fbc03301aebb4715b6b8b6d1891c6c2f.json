        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is a creative and original idea. The use of modern elements like dynamite and a laser shooter adds further originality, earning a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the laser shooter without prior context, which slightly disrupts the flow."
