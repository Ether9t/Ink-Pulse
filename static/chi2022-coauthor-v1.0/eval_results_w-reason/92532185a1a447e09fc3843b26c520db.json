        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the pig using the internet to research materials and the wolf attempting to counteract the pig's efforts with his own research. However, the concept of using depleted uranium and the twist that the house wasn't actually made of it are somewhat novel, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is generally maintained, but there are some awkward transitions, such as the abrupt mention of Amazon as the source of uranium and the sudden shift to the wolf's plan with the water truck. The narrative is mostly smooth but occasionally uneven, justifying a coherence score of 3."
