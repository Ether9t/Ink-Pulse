        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on reincarnation by introducing the concept of watching one's life as a movie and then having the opportunity to guide one's future self. This adds a creative twist to the traditional idea of reincarnation, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The narrative is generally well-structured, with a clear progression from the theater scene to the choice offered by the woman in white, and finally to the protagonist's role as a guardian angel. The transitions are mostly smooth, though there is a slight abruptness when the protagonist is suddenly in the delivery room. Overall, the coherence score is 4 due to the clear and logical flow of the story."
