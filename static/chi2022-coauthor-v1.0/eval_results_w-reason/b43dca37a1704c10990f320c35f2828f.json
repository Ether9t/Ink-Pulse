        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of reincarnation where past and future selves are connected through a cinematic experience, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of telepathic communication among reincarnations adds depth to the narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with smooth transitions from the protagonist's confusion to the realization of telepathic communication, justifying a coherence score of 4. However, the article could have explored the implications of this realization further to achieve a higher idea score."
