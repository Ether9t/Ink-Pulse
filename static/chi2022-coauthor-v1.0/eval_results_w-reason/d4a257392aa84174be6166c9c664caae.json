        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a nation falling behind due to isolation, with some development on the consequences of this isolation, such as technological and medical backwardness. The introduction of a 'deal with the devil' adds a novel angle, but it is not deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the consequences of isolation to the drastic decision made by the government. However, the transition to the civil war and the ultimate outcome feels somewhat abrupt and underdeveloped, leading to a coherence score of 3."
