        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a rescue mission for Matt Damon, with some development in the form of a team including a psychic and the subsequent political career of Damon. However, it lacks deep or creative expansion beyond the introduction, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure but has occasional unevenness, such as the abrupt transition from the rescue mission to Damon's political career and the psychic's betrayal. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed development of the plot points."
