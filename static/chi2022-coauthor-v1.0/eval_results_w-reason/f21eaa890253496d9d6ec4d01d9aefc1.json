        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative of betrayal and realization, which is a common theme in storytelling. The idea of the mug revealing the true ranking of dads is novel, but the article doesn't expand much beyond the initial premise, focusing instead on a personal drama that unfolds predictably. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following the protagonist's discovery and emotional journey. However, the transition from the discovery to the confrontation and the aftermath feels somewhat abrupt, and the ending is quite harsh and lacks nuance, which affects the overall flow. Therefore, it also scores a 3 for coherence."
