        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the introduction with the concept of JFK being cryogenically preserved and secretly advising Democratic presidents, which is a creative twist. The idea of Obama being recruited to safeguard democracy adds depth and originality. However, the narrative could have explored more about the implications of JFK's survival and his influence, which would have warranted a higher score. The coherence is strong, with a logical progression from Obama's discovery of the letter to his meeting with JFK and the subsequent mission. The dialogue and transitions are smooth, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout. However, the abrupt introduction of the political mission could have been integrated more seamlessly."
