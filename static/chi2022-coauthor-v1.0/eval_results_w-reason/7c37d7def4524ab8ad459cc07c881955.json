        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it explores the protagonist's newfound power over bees and the subsequent revenge on Soeurette. However, it lacks depth and originality beyond the initial concept of being the 'king of bees.' The idea of using bees for revenge is not particularly novel. The coherence score is 3 because the article maintains a generally coherent structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the protagonist's disbelief to ordering the bees to attack Soeurette. The narrative flow could be smoother, and the motivations and consequences could be more thoroughly explored."
