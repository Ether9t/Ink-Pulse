        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents some standard ideas with a bit of development beyond the introduction. The concept of the rich moving to the moon and the immortality drug containing tracers for hunting is a continuation of the dystopian theme, but it doesn't introduce multiple strong original ideas or deep expansion. The idea of a lottery to escape to the moon adds a layer of complexity, but it is not deeply explored. Coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the introduction of the setting to the discovery of the hunting practice. However, the transition to the protagonist's goal of reaching the moon feels somewhat abrupt, and the article could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed development of the protagonist's journey."
