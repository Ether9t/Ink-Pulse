        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by developing the relationship between Poc and Sara, introducing the twist of Poc's true identity as a shapeshifter, and exploring Sara's reaction to this revelation. While the concept of a shapeshifter in a romantic context is not entirely new, the article does provide a standard but well-developed narrative of love overcoming unusual obstacles. Therefore, it earns a 3 for idea score. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and smooth progression from the initial meeting to the revelation and resolution. The transitions between the different stages of their relationship are natural, and the narrative is consistent in style, earning it a 4 for coherence."
