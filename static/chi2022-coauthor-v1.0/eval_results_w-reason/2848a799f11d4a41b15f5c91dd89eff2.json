        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. It explores the consequences of immortality, such as the young becoming greedy and taking over the world, and the 'Lost Generations' plotting an escape. However, the concept of a hidden community of 'Lost Generations' with their own immortality drug is a somewhat novel angle, but not deeply explored. The coherence is generally maintained, with a clear narrative from escape to finding a new community. However, the transition from the escape to discovering the new drug is somewhat abrupt, and the resolution feels rushed, impacting the overall flow."
