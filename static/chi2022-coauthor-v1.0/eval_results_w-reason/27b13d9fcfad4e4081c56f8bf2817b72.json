        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous idea of an alien abducting Matt Damon because of his role in 'Good Will Hunting,' which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of the alien demanding a sequel and the subsequent success of 'Good Will Hunting 2' adds originality. The article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from abduction to resolution, and the transitions between sections are smooth, contributing to a coherent narrative. However, the idea could have been further developed with more depth into the alien's perspective or the making of the sequel, which is why it did not receive a perfect score."
