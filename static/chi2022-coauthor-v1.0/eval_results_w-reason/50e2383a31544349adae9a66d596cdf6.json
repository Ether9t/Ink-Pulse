        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, focusing on the theme of finding value in family and community over fame and wealth. This is a common narrative, but it is developed with specific examples of the protagonist's life as a peasant, such as marrying a wonderful man and having a close-knit family. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from initial disappointment to eventual fulfillment through family and community. The transitions between life events are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
