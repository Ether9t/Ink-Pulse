        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by exploring the consequences of immortality through memory loss, which is a unique angle beyond the introduction. It delves into the societal implications of a memory-less immortal population and the shift in power dynamics, which are clear new insights. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, particularly when discussing the eventual decline of the elderly and the resulting state of the world. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions between these sections to enhance the overall flow."
