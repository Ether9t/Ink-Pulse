        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and a wolf whose tears are acidic. This is a creative and original idea, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The story maintains a coherent structure, with a clear progression from the wolf's initial attempts to enter the house to the unexpected resolution where the wolf's tears dissolve the house. The transitions are smooth, and the tone remains consistent throughout, justifying a coherence score of 4."
