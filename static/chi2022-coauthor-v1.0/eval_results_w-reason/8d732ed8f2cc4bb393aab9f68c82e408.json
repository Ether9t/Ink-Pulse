        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a 92nd pig and a wolf who desires a strong house for security and friendship, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This earns it a high score for new ideas. However, the coherence score is slightly lower due to some uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the wolf's admiration to his attempt to replicate the house, and the sudden involvement of 92 pigs blowing down the wolf's house. These transitions could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
