        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of bees serving a human as their queen, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of bees providing honey and creating a personal cloud for shade is imaginative and adds depth to the narrative, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the princess's initial surprise to her enjoyment of the bees' services. The transitions between her requests and the bees' actions are smooth, and the stylistic tone remains consistent throughout, justifying a coherence score of 4."
