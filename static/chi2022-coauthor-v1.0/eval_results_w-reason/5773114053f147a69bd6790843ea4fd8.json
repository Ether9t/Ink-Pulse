        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig who builds a house out of depleted uranium and a wolf who is a vegetarian. This is a creative and humorous take, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The dialogue between the pig and the wolf about the dangers of uranium and the wolf's vegetarianism adds depth and originality. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the pig's initial problem to the resolution of becoming roommates with the wolf. The transitions between scenes, such as the pig inviting the wolf for tea and the subsequent invitation to be roommates, are smooth and contribute to a cohesive narrative."
