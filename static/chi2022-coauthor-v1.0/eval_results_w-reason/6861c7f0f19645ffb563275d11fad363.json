        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing the concept of a pig dealing in depleted uranium, which is an unexpected and creative angle. This originality earns it a high idea score of 4. The article maintains a coherent narrative, with logical progression from the wolf's curiosity to the business partnership with the pig. The dialogue between the characters is consistent and helps to develop the plot smoothly, justifying a coherence score of 4. However, the article could have been more detailed in exploring the implications of their business, which would have enhanced both the idea and coherence scores."
