        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it builds on the initial premise of a mysterious letter and turns it into a humorous birthday surprise involving past presidents. This twist adds a layer of creativity, but it doesn't deeply explore new concepts beyond the initial setup. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the mysterious letter to the birthday surprise. The transitions between scenes are smooth, and the tone remains consistent, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
