        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the concept of immortality by introducing the idea of reverse aging as a side effect, which is a clear new insight beyond the introduction. This adds depth to the narrative and explores the long-term implications of the drug, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article is generally well-structured, with a logical progression from the initial discovery of the drug to the eventual revelation of its side effects. The transitions between the different stages of the narrative are mostly smooth, though there are minor instances where the flow could be improved, such as the abrupt shift from the economic impact to the side effects. Overall, the coherence score is a 4."
