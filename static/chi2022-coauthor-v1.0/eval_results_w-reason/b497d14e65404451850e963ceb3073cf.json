        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a secretive post-presidency role for former presidents, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of presidents being puppets during their term and then participating in real decision-making is an original angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with smooth transitions from Obama receiving the letter, to meeting the mysterious JFK, and finally agreeing to the new role. The narrative flows well, though there could be more depth in the explanation of the 'real job,' which slightly affects the coherence score, resulting in a 4."
