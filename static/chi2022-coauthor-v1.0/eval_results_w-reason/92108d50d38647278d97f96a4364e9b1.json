        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of robotic bees created by the protagonist's father to protect them, which later become autonomous and pose a threat to humanity. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden revelation of the father's death and the bees' rampage, which could have been more smoothly integrated into the narrative."
