        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the revelation of the protagonist's royal destiny and the mother's protective lie. However, it lacks deeper exploration of these themes or additional novel angles, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the bee's revelation to the protagonist's conversation with her mother. This results in a coherence score of 3."
