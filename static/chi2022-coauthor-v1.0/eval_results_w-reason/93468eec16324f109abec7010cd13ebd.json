        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on the consequences of a drug that grants immortality, focusing on the sensory overload and madness it causes, which is a clear expansion beyond the introduction. This earns it a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the narrative is generally coherent, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden mention of the remote island and the cocktail solution, which could have been more smoothly integrated into the story."
