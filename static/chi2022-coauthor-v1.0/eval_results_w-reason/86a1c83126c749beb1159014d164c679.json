        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the protagonist's discovery of fatherhood and the subsequent emotional journey. It doesn't introduce multiple strong original ideas beyond the initial premise, but it does explore the emotional and relational aspects of the situation, which adds some depth. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured narrative that progresses logically from the protagonist's shock to the eventual meeting with his daughter. The transitions are smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone throughout, contributing to a high coherence score."
