        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing the concept of a house made of depleted uranium and the wolf's attempt to counter it with a uranium saw. This is a creative and original idea, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some repetitive elements (e.g., 'sawing and sawing and sawing') and a lack of depth in the wolf's thought process, which slightly disrupts the flow."
