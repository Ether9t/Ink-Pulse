        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is an original and creative idea. The concept of a wolf rental service and the pig's clever plan to trap the wolf and sell the land adds further originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the wolf's curiosity to the pig's clever trap and eventual departure. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone, justifying a coherence score of 4."
