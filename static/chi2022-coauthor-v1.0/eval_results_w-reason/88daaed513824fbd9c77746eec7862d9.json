        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard post-apocalyptic narrative with some development beyond the introduction, such as the introduction of a religious cult and a rebel group, which adds depth to the story. However, these elements are not particularly novel, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article maintains a generally coherent structure but has some uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the trial to the rescue by Joshua. The narrative flow could be smoother, and the stylistic consistency could be improved."
