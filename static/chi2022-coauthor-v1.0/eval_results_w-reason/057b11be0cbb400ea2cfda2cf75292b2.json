        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is an original and humorous idea. The interaction between the pig and the wolf over cheesecake adds a creative and unexpected angle, contributing to the new idea score of 4. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the wolf's initial threat to the resolution involving cheesecake. The dialogue and actions flow naturally, though there is a slight abruptness in the wolf's sudden shift from threatening to accepting cheesecake, which prevents a perfect score. Overall, the article is well-structured and maintains stylistic consistency, earning a coherence score of 4."
