        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development by introducing the concept of the 'Death Game' as a societal solution to the problem of immortality with low IQ. This adds a layer of complexity to the scenario, but it doesn't deeply explore the implications or alternatives, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is mostly smooth but has several awkward transitions, particularly in the abrupt introduction of the 'Retirement Zone' and the 'Death Game' without sufficient context or explanation. This results in a coherence score of 2."
