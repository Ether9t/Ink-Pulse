        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the notion that the U.S. was the only country to follow the isolation agreement due to its nuclear capabilities. However, it lacks depth and originality, as it primarily reiterates the power dynamics established in the introduction. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several awkward transitions and lacks a smooth flow. For instance, the narrative jumps from discussing the U.S.'s nuclear power to the idea of karma without a clear transition, making the article feel disjointed."
