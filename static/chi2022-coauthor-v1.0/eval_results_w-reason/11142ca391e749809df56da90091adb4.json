        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is a creative and unexpected idea. The wolf's attempt to disguise himself as a health inspector adds another layer of originality. However, the introduction of the pig getting cancer multiple times feels abrupt and somewhat disconnected from the rest of the narrative, which affects the coherence. The story maintains a generally coherent structure, but the transition to the pig's illness and eventual sainthood is jarring and detracts from the overall flow. Despite this, the article's creative elements and unique take on the story justify a high idea score."
