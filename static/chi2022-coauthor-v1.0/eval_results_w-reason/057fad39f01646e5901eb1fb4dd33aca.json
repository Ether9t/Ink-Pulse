        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of former presidents having magical powers to combat an alien invasion in the future, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This earns it a high score for new ideas. However, the coherence score is slightly lower because while the narrative is generally coherent, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the time machine and the concept of magical powers without much explanation or buildup. The story maintains a logical structure but could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed development of the plot elements."
