        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of increased paternal involvement due to a competitive ranking system, which is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel. The notion that competition drives men to be better fathers is developed but not deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the introduction of the ranking system to its effects on gender roles and family dynamics. However, the article occasionally lacks smooth transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing dads' motivations to the broader societal changes, leading to a coherence score of 3."
