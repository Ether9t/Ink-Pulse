        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of the elderly turning into zombies and the unique twist of the 85-year-olds' blood being a cure. However, it lacks depth and creativity beyond the initial premise, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is rated at 2 because the article has several awkward transitions and lacks a smooth narrative flow. For instance, the shift from the protest in Washington to the zombie outbreak is abrupt, and the explanation of the zombies' immunity to weapons feels disjointed from the rest of the narrative."
