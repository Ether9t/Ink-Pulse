        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article provides some ideas about the impact of technology on society, such as increased connectivity and changes in socialization, but these are fairly standard observations and not particularly novel, resulting in a score of 2 for new ideas. The article lacks depth in exploring the implications of the U.S. isolation compared to the rest of the world, which could have been a more original angle. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, discussing technology's impact on communication and learning from past mistakes. However, it occasionally lacks smooth transitions between points, such as the abrupt shift from discussing children's socialization to global diplomacy, which affects the flow, leading to a coherence score of 3."
