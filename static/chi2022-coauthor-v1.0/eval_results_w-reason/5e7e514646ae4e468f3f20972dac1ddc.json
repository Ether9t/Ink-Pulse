        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative of a woman repeatedly dating the same shapeshifter, which is a novel concept, but the execution beyond the introduction is fairly predictable. The idea of the shapeshifter losing his ability and being revealed as a man with a Napoleon complex adds some originality, but it is not deeply explored. Thus, the idea score is a 3. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following the woman's journey through relationships, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the woman's heartbreak to meeting a new man. The ending also feels rushed, with the shapeshifter's fate being quickly summarized. Therefore, the coherence score is also a 3."
