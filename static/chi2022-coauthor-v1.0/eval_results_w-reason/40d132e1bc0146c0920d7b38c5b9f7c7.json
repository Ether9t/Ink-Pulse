        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the shapeshifter's strategy of transforming into the woman's doppelganger, which is an unexpected twist beyond the introduction. This adds a layer of originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the narrative generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shapeshifter's sudden decision to become her doppelganger and the quick move-in scenario, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
