        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development beyond the introduction. It expands on the consequences of the US's isolation, such as technological regression and the need to learn from other countries, which are logical extensions of the introduction but not particularly novel. The mention of helium-3 and its impact on energy is a slightly new angle, but not deeply explored. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured narrative that logically progresses from the US's isolation to its current challenges and the global advancements. Transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
