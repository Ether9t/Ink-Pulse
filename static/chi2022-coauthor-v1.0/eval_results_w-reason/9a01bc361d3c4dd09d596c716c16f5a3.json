        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the concept of choosing one's next life and the reflection on past lives. It touches on the desire to leave a legacy and the hope for reincarnation or heaven, which are common themes in discussions about life after death. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond these standard ideas, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from watching one's life, reflecting on choices, and contemplating future possibilities. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, earning a score of 4 for coherence."
