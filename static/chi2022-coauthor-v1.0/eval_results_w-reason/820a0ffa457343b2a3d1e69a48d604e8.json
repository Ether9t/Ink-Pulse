        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. It introduces the concept of time travel to prevent the distribution of the drug and uncovers a government conspiracy, which adds a layer of intrigue and moral complexity. However, these ideas are not deeply explored or particularly novel, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the mission's completion to the protagonist's new life in hiding. This results in a coherence score of 3."
