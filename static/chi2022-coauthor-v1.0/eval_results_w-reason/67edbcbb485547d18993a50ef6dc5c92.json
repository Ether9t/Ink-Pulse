        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article introduces the idea that aliens have awakened the old power of the human mind, which is a continuation of the introduction but lacks depth or originality beyond the initial premise. The concept of humans being hunted by other humans turned into monsters is mentioned but not developed, resulting in a fragmented presentation of ideas. Coherence is also lacking, as the article jumps between topics such as the aliens' intentions, the power of the human soul, and the chaotic state of the world without smooth transitions or a clear logical structure. The narrative feels disjointed, with abrupt shifts in focus and tone."
