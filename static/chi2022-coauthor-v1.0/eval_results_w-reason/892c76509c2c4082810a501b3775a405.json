        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a God-like figure granting miracles, which is a common theme in literature and philosophy. It does touch on the pressures and responsibilities of such a role, which adds some depth, but it doesn't introduce significantly novel concepts beyond the introduction. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the responsibilities and implications of granting miracles, but it occasionally shifts focus abruptly, such as moving from the nature of humans to the concept of reincarnation without smooth transitions. This results in a coherence score of 3."
