        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of self-improvement and personal growth, which is a common theme in romantic narratives. The twist of the woman knowing about the shapeshifter's identity adds a slight novel angle, but it doesn't deeply expand beyond the introduction's premise. Therefore, the idea score is a 3. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the shapeshifter's initial struggles to his eventual self-realization and the revelation from the woman. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, earning it a coherence score of 4."
