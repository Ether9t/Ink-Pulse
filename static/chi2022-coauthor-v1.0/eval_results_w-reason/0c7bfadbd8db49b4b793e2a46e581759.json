        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the consequences of a society divided by access to immortality drugs, and the eventual reversal of roles between the 'Lost' and 'Lucky' generations. The idea of the Lost developing superior technology and eventually needing to intervene to save the Lucky is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. However, the article could delve deeper into the societal and ethical implications of these developments. The coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden disappearance of the Lucky and the shift to the Lost forming new governments. These transitions could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
