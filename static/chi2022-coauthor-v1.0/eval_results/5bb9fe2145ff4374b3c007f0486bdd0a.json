        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development beyond the introduction. It explores the woman's realization and her decision to confront the shapeshifter, which adds a layer of depth to the narrative. However, it doesn't introduce multiple strong original ideas or deep insights, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from the woman's discovery to her decision to communicate with the shapeshifter. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, earning a score of 4 for coherence."
