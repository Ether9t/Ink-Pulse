        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of a secret group of former presidents, the 'C-Team', dealing with supernatural and extraterrestrial threats, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of JFK leading this group and the use of advanced technology like a helicopter with rocket engines adds originality. However, the article could delve deeper into the specifics of the threats or the operations of the C-Team for a higher score. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from receiving the letter to the space station meeting with JFK. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative is consistent, though the rapid shift from a helicopter to space travel could be more detailed to enhance the flow."
