        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing depleted uranium as a building material, which is an original and humorous concept. The interaction between the wolf and the pigs, especially the wolf's concern for safety and the use of a radiation tool, adds a creative angle to the narrative. The idea of the wolf and pig deciding to have lunch together after the house is blown up is another unique twist. For coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression of events. The dialogue between the characters is consistent and contributes to the story's humor. However, the transition from the wolf's initial hesitation to using dynamite could have been smoother, which slightly affects the coherence score."
