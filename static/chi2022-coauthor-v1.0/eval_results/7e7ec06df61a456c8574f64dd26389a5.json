        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the lesson that words should not have undue power over emotions and priorities. This is a common theme, but the use of an alien science experiment adds a slight novel angle, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, moving from the dads' confusion to the alien's explanation and the lesson learned. However, the transition from the dads' meeting to the alien's message is somewhat abrupt, and the article could benefit from smoother transitions and more stylistic consistency, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
