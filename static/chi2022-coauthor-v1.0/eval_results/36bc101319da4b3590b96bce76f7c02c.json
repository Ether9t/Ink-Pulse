        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat shallow exploration of the concept introduced. The idea of a woman unknowingly dating a shapeshifter is not deeply expanded upon, and the focus shifts to her personal growth and realization, which is a common narrative in romantic stories. Thus, it scores a 2 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, following Helena's journey from self-doubt to self-discovery and love. However, the transition from her realization to meeting Ben feels somewhat abrupt, and the shapeshifter element is not integrated smoothly, leading to a coherence score of 3."
