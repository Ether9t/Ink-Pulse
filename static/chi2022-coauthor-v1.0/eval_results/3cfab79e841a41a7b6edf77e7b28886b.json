        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the concept of Matt Damon being rescued, with the unexpected element of an intergalactic Taco Bell and Matt Damon becoming its regional manager. This creative expansion beyond the introduction earns a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from Matt Damon being terrified to him being in a Taco Bell drive-thru without a clear explanation of how he got there. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed explanations to enhance coherence."
