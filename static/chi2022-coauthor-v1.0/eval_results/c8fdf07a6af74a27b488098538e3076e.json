        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. The concept of a human being chosen as a queen by bees and negotiating a deal for protection is a creative expansion, but it doesn't delve deeply into new insights or multiple strong original ideas, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence of the article is strong, with a clear and logical progression from the initial surprise of the talking bee to the resolution of the protagonist's allergy concern. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, justifying a coherence score of 4."
