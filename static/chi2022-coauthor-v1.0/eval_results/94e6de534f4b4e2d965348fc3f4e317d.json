        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the introduction's premise of being the 'Keeper of the Bees' and introduces a unique narrative about discovering one's true identity and purpose. The concept of a hidden prophecy and the protagonist's role in saving bees from extinction adds depth and originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the initial encounter with the bee to the revelation in the cave. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the narrative is consistent, though there are minor areas where the flow could be slightly improved, such as the abruptness of the protagonist's acceptance of their role. Overall, the article is well-structured, justifying a coherence score of 4."
