        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of overcoming fear and misunderstanding, with the protagonist realizing that bees are not to be feared but respected. This is a common theme, hence the idea score of 3. However, the twist of being chosen as a queen adds a slight novel angle. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the protagonist's initial fear to acceptance and leadership. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative is consistent, though it lacks deeper exploration of the protagonist's transformation."
