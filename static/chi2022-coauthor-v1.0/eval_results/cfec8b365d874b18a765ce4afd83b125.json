        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of the U.S. emerging as a superpower due to its isolation, with some development on how it uses its technological and military advantages to dominate the world. However, it lacks deep exploration of the implications or novel insights beyond the initial premise, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is rated at 2 because the article has several awkward transitions and shifts in focus, such as the abrupt mention of the pandemic and the speculative nature of the conclusion, which disrupts the flow and makes the narrative feel somewhat disjointed."
