        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a post-apocalyptic game scenario with some development, such as the unique twist of the US being the only nation in isolation and the Soviet Union's global dominance. However, it doesn't delve deeply into these concepts, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also a 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure and flow, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from game mechanics to level design without a smooth transition. Overall, the article is coherent but lacks depth in its exploration of new ideas."
