        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a young protagonist discovering latent powers, which is a common trope in fantasy and science fiction. However, it does develop the concept by introducing the societal context of a post-alien invasion world where mana is reawakening, which adds some depth. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from John's school life to the revelation of his powers and the subsequent opportunity. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, earning it a coherence score of 4."
