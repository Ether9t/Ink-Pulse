        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of rebuilding society with teams of specialists, which is a logical extension of the introduction but lacks significant originality, earning it a score of 3 for new ideas. The introduction of a hidden group adds a slight twist, but it is not deeply explored. Coherence is generally maintained, with a clear progression from rebuilding to the discovery of the hidden group. However, the transition to the hidden group and their integration is somewhat abrupt and lacks depth, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
