        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing the progression of the relationship between the woman and the shapeshifter, including specific events like the Broadway play and the revelation of his shapeshifting ability. However, the ideas are fairly standard and predictable, focusing on trust and honesty in relationships, which are common themes. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear narrative arc from initial meeting to eventual marriage, maintaining a logical flow and natural progression. There are no abrupt shifts or jarring transitions, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
