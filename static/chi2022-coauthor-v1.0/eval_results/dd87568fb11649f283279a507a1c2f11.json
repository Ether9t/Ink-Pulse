        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the twist of the wolf wanting to build a similar house and the pig's naivety leading to the loss of his home. These elements add a new angle to the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story, but they are not deeply explored or particularly original, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from the wolf's initial admiration to the pig's downfall. However, there are some awkward transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the petition and the wolves' deception, which slightly disrupt the flow, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
