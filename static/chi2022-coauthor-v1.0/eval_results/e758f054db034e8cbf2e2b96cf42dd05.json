        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents some standard ideas with development beyond the introduction, such as the concept of 'Watchers' and the unexpected population boom as a human strength. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the Watchers' role to the population boom and the final return of the Watchers. These transitions could be smoother, leading to a coherence score of 3."
