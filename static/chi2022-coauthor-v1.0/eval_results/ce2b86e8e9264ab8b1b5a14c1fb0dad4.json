        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by suggesting that JFK faked his death and has been living in hiding, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of a secret server with hidden government files adds another layer of originality. However, the article could have explored the implications of these revelations more deeply to achieve a higher score. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from Obama's decision not to release the files to the news of JFK releasing them. This affects the overall flow, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
