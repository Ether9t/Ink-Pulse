        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig who builds a house out of depleted uranium and a wolf who uses cockroaches to breach it. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a coherent narrative with a logical progression from the wolf's initial failure to his clever use of cockroaches, and the humorous conclusion with the bet, which is well-structured and consistent in style, justifying a coherence score of 4."
