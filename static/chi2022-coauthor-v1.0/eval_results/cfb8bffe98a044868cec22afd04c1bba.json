        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article does not significantly expand on the introduction's concept of a shapeshifter dating the same woman repeatedly. Instead, it focuses on a relationship where the woman struggles with bipolar disorder, which is unrelated to the shapeshifter theme. This results in a fragmented and shallow exploration of the original idea, meriting a score of 2 for new ideas. Coherence is also rated at 2 because the article lacks smooth transitions and logical structure. The narrative jumps from relationship issues to a mental health diagnosis and resolution without clear connections to the shapeshifter premise, leading to awkward transitions and a disjointed feel."
