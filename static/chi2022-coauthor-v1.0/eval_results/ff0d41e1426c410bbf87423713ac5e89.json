        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by exploring the emotional journey of the woman and the shapeshifter, adding depth to their relationship. However, the ideas are fairly standard, focusing on themes of trust and self-discovery, which are common in romantic narratives. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea development. The coherence score is a 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the initial meeting to the resolution. The transitions between events, such as the carnival date and the revelation of the man's true nature, are smooth, though the resolution feels somewhat rushed."
