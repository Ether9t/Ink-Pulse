        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. The concept of a shapeshifter repeatedly dating the same woman is intriguing, but the article doesn't delve deeply into the implications or explore new angles beyond the initial premise. The twist of the boyfriend being a shapeshifter from another solar system adds a layer of novelty, but it is not fully explored or developed. Coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the woman's realization to the boyfriend's explanation. The narrative maintains a logical structure, but the stylistic consistency could be improved, particularly in the dialogue and the pacing of the story."
