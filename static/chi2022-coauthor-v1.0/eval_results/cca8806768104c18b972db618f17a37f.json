        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and creative scenario where former presidents, including a resurrected JFK, are involved in a secret mission to stop Mark Zuckerberg from using AI for world domination. This is a unique and imaginative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the narrative is generally coherent, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden appearance of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, and the quick shift from selling ice cream to infiltrating the compound. These transitions could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
