        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the shapeshifter's repeated attempts to perfect himself for the woman he loves. This concept is not entirely novel, as it follows a common trope of someone changing themselves for love, but it does offer a unique twist with the shapeshifter element. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the woman's initial feelings to the revelation of the shapeshifter's identity. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
