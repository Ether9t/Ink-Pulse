        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. It introduces 'The Madness' as a side effect of the immortality drug, which is a logical extension of the premise but not particularly novel. The concept of using a new drug to reverse the effects and the method of distribution via 'bombs' and planes adds some depth, but these ideas are not deeply explored or particularly original. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, with a clear narrative progression from the discovery of side effects to the government's response. However, the transition from the introduction of 'The Madness' to the government's drastic measures feels somewhat abrupt, and the article could benefit from more detailed exploration of the societal impact and ethical considerations. Overall, the article is coherent but occasionally uneven in its transitions and development."
