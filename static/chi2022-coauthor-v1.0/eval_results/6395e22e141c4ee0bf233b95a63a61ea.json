        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of fame energy and Ben Affleck's expertise in teleportation, which are interesting but not deeply explored. The narrative follows a typical rescue mission plot without introducing multiple strong original ideas, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the alien abduction to the rescue mission. The transitions are smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone, justifying a coherence score of 4."
