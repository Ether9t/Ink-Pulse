        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is an original and creative idea. The concept of the wolf consulting a scientist for a solution adds another layer of creativity, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the wolf's initial failure to his consultation with the scientist and subsequent attempts to destroy the house. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the narrative is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
