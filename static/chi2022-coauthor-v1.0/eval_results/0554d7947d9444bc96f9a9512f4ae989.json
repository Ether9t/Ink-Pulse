        "idea_score": 3,

        "reason": "The article presents a standard exploration of the concept of reincarnation by focusing on the interaction between different versions of the protagonist. The idea of meeting past reincarnations and discussing their lives adds some depth, but it doesn't significantly expand beyond the introduction's premise. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the initial conversation to the emotional exchange between the two characters. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
