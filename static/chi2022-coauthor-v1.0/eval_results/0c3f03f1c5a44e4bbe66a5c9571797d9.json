        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat shallow expansion of the introduction's premise. The idea of a 'Ninja Rescue Team' is introduced, but the narrative follows a predictable path without much depth or creativity beyond the initial setup. The concept of ninjas fighting aliens is not explored in a novel way, resulting in a fragmented and shallow development of the idea. For coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, with a clear sequence of events: the ninjas realize Matt Damon is missing, they search for him, find him, and rescue him. However, the transitions between these events are somewhat abrupt, and the narrative lacks stylistic refinement, leading to a score of 3 for coherence."
