        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding the concept of a former U.S. President being recruited for a galactic leadership role, which is a creative and original angle beyond the introduction. This earns it a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of past Presidents and the Galactic Council, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
