        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it explores the concept of a secret project led by JFK to create a new superpower to motivate the U.S. This is an interesting twist, but it doesn't delve deeply into the implications or mechanics of such a project, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, following Obama's journey from receiving the letter to implementing the project. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the quick acceptance of JFK's plan by Obama's colleagues, which could have been more developed. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
