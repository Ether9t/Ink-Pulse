        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the mysterious call from 'JFK' and the subsequent meeting, which adds a layer of intrigue and suspense. However, it lacks depth and originality beyond the initial premise. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the phone call to meeting JFK and then waking up in a sweat, which disrupts the narrative flow. The story feels fragmented, and the transitions between events are not smooth, affecting the overall coherence."
