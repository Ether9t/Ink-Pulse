        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it builds on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a novel twist with the 92nd pig using depleted uranium for its house. The wolf's attempt to lure the pig out with food is a creative angle, but the resolution is predictable, leading to a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with clear transitions from the wolf's frustration to his plan and the eventual outcome. The narrative is consistent and flows well, though the ending is somewhat abrupt."
