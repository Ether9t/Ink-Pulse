        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it explores the concept of both characters being shapeshifters, which adds a twist to the initial premise. However, it doesn't delve deeply into the implications or complexities of this revelation, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with clear transitions from Clive's initial seminar experience to the encounter with Liz. The narrative flows well, though it could benefit from more stylistic refinement to achieve a perfect score."
