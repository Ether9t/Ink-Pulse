        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and sets a trap for the wolf. This is a clear new insight and a creative expansion beyond the introduction, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with the wolf's obsession and eventual demise being well-developed. The transitions between the wolf's actions and the pig's responses are smooth, and the stylistic consistency is maintained throughout, justifying a coherence score of 4."
