        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of time travel to prevent a future catastrophe, which is a common trope in science fiction. However, it does develop the scenario by introducing the concept of convincing a scientist to abandon his research, which adds some depth to the narrative. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression from the protagonist's realization of the side effects to the confrontation with the scientist and the resolution. The transitions are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
