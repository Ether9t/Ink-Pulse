        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a post-isolation world with mutants, which is a common trope in speculative fiction. The concept of adapting to a barter system and the absence of the internet are interesting but not deeply explored, leading to a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are some uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the protagonist's personal reflections to their decision to join the group exploring the new world. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed exploration of the new societal structures."
