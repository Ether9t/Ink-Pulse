        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights and novel angles beyond the introduction, such as the societal impact of immortality, the emotional and ethical dilemmas faced by both the 'Lost Generation' and the immortals, and the eventual tragic side effects of the drug. These elements contribute to a deeper exploration of the topic, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from the initial discovery of the drug to the eventual realization of its side effects. The narrative maintains a consistent tone and logical flow, though there are minor instances where transitions could be smoother, justifying a coherence score of 4."
