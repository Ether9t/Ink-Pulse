        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it follows the introduction's premise of a shapeshifter dating the same woman repeatedly. The twist of the shapeshifter revealing himself adds a slight novel angle, but it doesn't deeply expand beyond the introduction's concept. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the coffee shop meeting to the revelation. However, there are moments of awkwardness, such as the shapeshifter's odd comments about drinking coffee, which could confuse the reader. Overall, the article is coherent but occasionally uneven in its transitions and dialogue."
