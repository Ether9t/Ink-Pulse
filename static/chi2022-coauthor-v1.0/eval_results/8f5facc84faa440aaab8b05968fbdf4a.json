        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a house made of depleted uranium, which is an original and creative idea. The wolf's attempt to blow up the house with dynamite adds another layer of creativity, as it involves an unexpected collaboration with China. These elements contribute to a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the wolf's initial failure to blow down the house, to his plan to use dynamite, and finally to his decision to leave the pig alone. The transitions between these events are smooth, and the narrative is consistent in style, earning a coherence score of 4."
