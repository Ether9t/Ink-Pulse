        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about reincarnation and the afterlife, such as the notion of experiencing different roles and the concept of choosing one's next life, which are common in discussions about reincarnation. It also touches on beliefs about the afterlife, such as heaven being a place of eternal bliss, which are well-trodden themes. Therefore, the idea score is 3 for standard ideas with some development. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, discussing reincarnation, ghostly existence, and the afterlife in a sequential manner. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing reincarnation to the experience of being a ghost, which affects the overall flow. Thus, the coherence score is 3."
