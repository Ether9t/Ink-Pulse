        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by introducing the concept of a pig building a house out of depleted uranium and the wolf's unexpected reaction due to its radioactivity. This is a creative twist on the classic tale, earning a high score for new ideas. The narrative further develops by exploring the wolf's loneliness and the pig's initiative to integrate him into the community, which is a fresh take on resolving conflict. For coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the initial problem to the resolution. The transitions between the pig's realization, the wolf's perspective, and the community's change in attitude are smooth, though there are minor areas where the flow could be slightly more refined."
