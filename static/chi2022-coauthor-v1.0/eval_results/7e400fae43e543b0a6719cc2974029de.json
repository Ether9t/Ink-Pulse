        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the life of the 92nd little pig, who builds a house out of depleted uranium, leading to isolation and despair. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are moments where the transitions between the pig's activities and his emotional state feel abrupt, such as the shift from his activism to his struggles with addiction."
