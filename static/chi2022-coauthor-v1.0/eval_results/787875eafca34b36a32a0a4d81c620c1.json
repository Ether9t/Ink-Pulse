        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development beyond the introduction. It explores the theme of humans needing to live in harmony with nature to access Mana, which is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel. The journey to Greece and the interaction with the Gods add some depth, but the overall concept remains within expected boundaries. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a well-structured narrative with clear progression from the journey to Greece, the encounter with the Gods, and the realization of the need for further self-improvement. Transitions are smooth, and the stylistic consistency is maintained throughout."
