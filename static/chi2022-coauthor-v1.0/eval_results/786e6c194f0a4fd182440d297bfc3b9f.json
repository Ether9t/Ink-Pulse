        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by exploring the protagonist's reflections on their past lives and the anticipation of their future life. It introduces the novel idea of watching one's future life as a movie, which is a creative expansion. However, the exploration of these ideas remains somewhat standard, focusing on familiar themes of reincarnation and the desire to retain past life knowledge, which limits the score to a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured, with a clear progression from the protagonist's reflections on past lives to their anticipation of the new life. The transitions between these sections are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, justifying a score of 4 for coherence."
