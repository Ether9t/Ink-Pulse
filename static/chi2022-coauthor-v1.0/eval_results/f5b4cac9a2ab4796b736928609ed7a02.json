        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and creative idea by expanding on the introduction with the concept of JFK being an alien and the subsequent plot to save Earth from an alien invasion. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of scientists and the development of a force field without much detail on the process. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed explanations to enhance coherence."
