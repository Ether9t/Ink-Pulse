        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by introducing the 92nd pig and his unique house made of depleted uranium, which is a creative twist beyond the traditional story of the three little pigs. The interaction with the wolf and the arrival of the famous brothers add depth to the narrative, contributing to the originality. However, the coherence score is slightly lower due to some awkward transitions, such as the sudden appearance of the brothers and the wolf's quick departure, which disrupts the flow. Overall, the article maintains a generally coherent structure with some unevenness in transitions."
