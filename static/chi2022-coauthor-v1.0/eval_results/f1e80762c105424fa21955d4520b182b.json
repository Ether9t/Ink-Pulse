        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article scores a 2 for New Idea because it primarily focuses on a predictable narrative of Obama enjoying his retirement and spending time with Michelle, which is a standard and expected scenario given the introduction. There is little expansion on the intriguing premise of JFK's mysterious job offer, which could have provided more original content. For Coherence, the article scores a 4 as it maintains a logical structure and smooth progression from Obama's decision to decline JFK's offer to his evening with Michelle. The transitions between scenes are natural, and the style remains consistent throughout, contributing to a well-structured narrative."
