        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on the concept of immortality by introducing the idea of a side effect that leads to a new form of natural selection, which is a clear expansion beyond the introduction. This adds depth to the narrative by exploring the consequences of immortality in a unique way. The coherence is strong, with a logical progression from the protagonist's personal experiences to the broader societal implications. The transitions between personal observations and the larger phenomenon are smooth, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout. However, the article could delve deeper into the societal impact and the science behind the side effects for a higher idea score."
