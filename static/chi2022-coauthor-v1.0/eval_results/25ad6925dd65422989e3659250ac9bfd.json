        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of parallel worlds with two versions of JFK, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This concept of parallel time zones adds a unique twist to the narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are moments of confusion, such as the abrupt acceptance of the parallel worlds theory without much exploration or transition. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed exploration of the implications of the parallel worlds concept."
