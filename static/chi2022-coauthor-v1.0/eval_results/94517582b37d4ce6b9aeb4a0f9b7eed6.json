        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a 92nd pig with a house made of depleted uranium, which is a creative and humorous concept. The wolf's attempts to research and collaborate with the pig's enemies add further originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is strong, with a logical progression from the wolf's initial failure to his collaboration with the pig's brothers, and a consistent tone throughout. However, the transition to targeting the 94th pig feels slightly abrupt, preventing a perfect score, thus a coherence score of 4."
