        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the protagonist's transformation from a bee to a human and the revelation of their true identity. However, it lacks deeper exploration of these concepts, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the protagonist's internal conflict to the decision to kill the bee. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed exploration of the protagonist's emotions and decisions."
