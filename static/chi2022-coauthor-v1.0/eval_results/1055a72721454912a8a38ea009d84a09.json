        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it introduces the concept of former presidents being immortal and part of a secret group aiming to take over the world. This is a somewhat novel angle, but it doesn't delve deeply into the implications or mechanics of this scenario, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, moving from Obama's disbelief to his acceptance of the situation. However, the transition from the introduction of JFK to the revelation of the secret group feels somewhat abrupt, and the dialogue could be more polished, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
