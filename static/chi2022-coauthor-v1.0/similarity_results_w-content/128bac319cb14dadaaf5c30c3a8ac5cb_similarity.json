You are eons away from getting married, despite having an active presence on Tinder.\n\n\"Well, you're getting married to the King of the bees,\" Mikey says. \"Who else would you get married to?\" You have never once in your life considered that you would ever marry the King of the bees, and this news shocks you now. \n\n\"But...but...but...I'm not a bee!\" you say. Mikey brushes your concerns aside. \"Come, let's plan your wedding. What flavor cake do you want?\" \n\n\"I don't want a cake! I don't want to get married!\" you say. You had long ago sworn off men since you were sure that you didn't want to deal with the heartache you felt when your ex left you. Mikey is not convinced. \"Come, let's go to the florist. What color flowers do you want?\" You are flabbergasted by Mike's persistence at planning a wedding you don't want to have. \n\n\"Mikey, I'm not getting married to the King of the bees! I'm not even dating anyone!\" Mikey laughs at your protests. \"Come, let's go to the dressmaker. What style of dress do you want?\" You have no idea what to say. After an afternoon of cake tastings, catering tastings, dress fitting, and tiara shopping, you are exhausted. Mikey says that you should go home and get some rest. He says the day has been a total success. You get home and see your mom. She asks you how the wedding planning went. \n\n\"I'm not getting married to the King of the bees!\" you say. Your mom laughs. \"Oh, honey, you're not getting married to the King of the bees. I hired Mikey to help you get back out there and find a man. You've been so sad since your last boyfriend left you. I thought you needed a push in the right direction. I'm sorry if I overstepped my bounds. But I just wanted you to see how exciting it could be to date again, since it would be so exciting for you to plan a real wedding.\" You are floored. You had never considered that your mom would hire a bee to help you find a boyfriend. Honestly, you are a little concerned that your mom would go to such great lengths. \n\n\"So...so...so...I'm not getting married to the King of the bees?\" you ask. \n\n\"No honey, you're not getting married to the King of the bees.\" your mom says. \n\n\"Oh, thank goodness.\" you say. \n\n\"But honey, you should really consider dating again.
