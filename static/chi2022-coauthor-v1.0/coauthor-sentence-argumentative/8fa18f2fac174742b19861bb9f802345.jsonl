Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, what makes a character portrayal offensive is its unreality. And there's an easy test for that: If I am reading or watching a movie and I find that I have not developed empathy for a character, then that character has likely been portrayed in a way that is not fully formed, and hence is unreal.\n\nAn example of a \"real\" character is the portrayal of Captain Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, in the BBC/Acorn show Line of Duty. Captains Hastings is not likeable, in fact borderline cringeworthy, but he is real and I found myself caring deeply what happens to him in spite of my personal dislike of him.\n",
