When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n\nThere were only 8 of us left. The last blast from the aliens destroyed much of the life on earth and the ones who were left were stranded on an island. We were all that was left to carry on the human race. The legend of the power called Mana was still shared but we thought it was gone forever. Then one by one, we began to see signs of that power returning. I looked in the mirror one morning and saw that I was glowing. I had no idea what was going on. I shared this with the other 7 and we found that it was all of us. \"What could this mean?\" I wondered.\n\nWe decided that we needed to get together and figure out what was going on. We gathered in a cave not far from where we lived. We thought maybe if we tried to glow together in the same space it would help us figure out what was going on and why we were glowing. So we all stood in this dark cave for nearly an hour and then slowly, one by one, we all began to glow in the dark, illuminating the cave. The glow grew stronger and brighter. There were bats in the cave and they all flew away from the bright light that we were producing. At that moment, we felt like we were glowing with the power of the Mana once again. When we stepped out of the cave, we were all glowing and continuing to glow brighter and stronger.\n",

This glowing WAS the Mana! and we knew we were invincible to harm with it. We were able to harness this from then on to protect us from hostile aliens wishing to attack. In the end what they did to our planet merely helped us survive. Even if it was only 8 of us. \n",
