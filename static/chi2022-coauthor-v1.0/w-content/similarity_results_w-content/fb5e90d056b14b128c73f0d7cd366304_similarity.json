When a person is sitting alone at a computer they are more likely to present themselves in a non realistic way that does not reflect who they really are. People can also see themselves in a way that is not real and then state that in their profile for instance, someone may see themselves as better looking than they really are and as a result will lie about their height, weight and physical characteristics. An online dating forum gives people an opportunity to daydream and be unrealistic about themselves and then in turn be unrealistic in their requirements for others. \n",

It is best that people try to meet people in a more natural and realistic setting where others can see you for what you really are instead of some made up mental image that is not real. When a relationship begins in a more natural environment then it is the result of honesty and reality and it has a better chance of succeeding and building a future. When a relationship begins as a result of an online dating site, be prepared for lies, disappointment and an unrealistic outcome that is most likely not as described. Be true to yourself and face reality. \n",
