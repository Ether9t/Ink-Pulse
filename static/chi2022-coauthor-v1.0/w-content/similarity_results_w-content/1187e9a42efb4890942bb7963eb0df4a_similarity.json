No matter if you're a Trump supporter or not, the things that he has done since taking office have been huge news.  The same with Biden. Fake news has also been a huge topic, and it is inevitable that people will misunderstand what is going on. If you are informed, you can help others understand what is really happening. \n\nJust by being informed, you will be able to connect the things you learn to things that you already know.
