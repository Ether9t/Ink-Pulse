        "sentence": "Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?\n\nHave you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty\"? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, I think that schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students with a quota restriction because they are a necessity. Pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools because they basic necessity. Pads and tampons are a necessity for women, especially when they experience period poverty. Period poverty is a term used to describe the lack of access to feminine hygiene products. Period poverty is a real issue that affects women and girls around the world. According to a study by the United Nations, more than 800 million women and girls around the world lack access to feminine hygiene products. This is a huge problem because it can lead to health issues such as infections, reproductive tract infections and cervical cancer. It can also adversely affect the mental health of women and girls because their moods change easily during their periods. Pads and tampons are not a luxury item, they are a necessity. The United States government has already taken steps to help women and girls who experience period poverty. For example, the United States government has provided feminine hygiene products to women and girls in refugee camps. As a conclusion, I think that schools should provide free pads and tampons to female students with a quota restriction. \n",
