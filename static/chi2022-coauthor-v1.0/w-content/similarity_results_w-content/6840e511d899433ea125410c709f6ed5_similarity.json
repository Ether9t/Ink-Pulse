The driver delivered the package to the wrong house. Frustrated, you make your way back to the pond. The mug is floating in the water, so you reach down into the pond and retrieve it. Just as you are about to grab it, a huge catfish swims by and snatches the mug away with his long whiskers. Shocked, you realize no one will ever know what a great dad you are since the mug is long gone by now in the murky depths of the disgusting body of water. \n",
