There is no way I will let servants talk to me like that! I run back to the deck, and grab the first maid by the hair. \"How dare you talk about me like that!\" I scream, as I pull her to the ground. \"I am the queen, and you will show me respect!\" \n\n\"I'm sorry, Your Majesty\", the maid says, as she tries to get up. I kick her in the stomach, and she falls back to the ground. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\" she screams. \n\n\"I'm not done with you yet\", I say, as I grab her by the neck. \"You will never disrespect me again, or I will have you executed.\" I let go of her, and she crawls away. \"Now, I'm going back to my party.\" \n\nI walk back to the party, and the guests are all staring at me. \"What are you looking at?\" I say. \"I was just teaching a servant a lesson.\" \n\"I think you should go back to your room\", my husband says. \"You've been acting really strange lately.\" \n\"I'm fine, I'm fine\", I say. \"I'm just going to go get a drink.\" \n\nI walk over to the bar, and the bartender hands me a drink. I don't notice that my husband has my meds in hand, and slips them into my drink. I take a sip, and I feel a wave of calm wash over me. I feel so much better, so much more relaxed.\n",
