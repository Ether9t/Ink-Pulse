And he thought about all of the ways that people had been discriminating against him in a way that was completely unfair. And he had a long list. For example, at the zoo he always got to sit in the last car of the train, and people would throw things at him, which wasn't fair. And sometimes when he went to the beach, people would put up fences so he couldn't get to the water. The wolf felt increasingly depressed thinking of all the ways that showed he was a disliked creature. He knew his lawyer would need to dazzle the judge.\n\nOn the day of the hearing, the wolf's lawyer stood before the judge and said, \"Your honor, I have here a petition for damages.\" And the judge was like, \"Why does this petition say that we're here to talk about a lawsuit against the pigs?\" And the lawyer explained, \"Yes your honor, we are here to talk about a lawsuit against the pigs. My client is here to talk about the unfair portrayal of wolves in the story of the three little pigs.\" \"I'm listening,\" said the judge. \"Your honor, the wolf is an upstanding citizen. And that story is a total lie! It never happened and the pigs just wanted sympathy from people all around the world. But that story is so out there that it has caused my client to suffer undue discrimination. My client is now suing for damages, which he believes is fair.\" The pigs who are the named defendants in the suit were flabbergasted.

So, the judge awarded the wolf $123.45 million in damages and ordered that any further retelling of the story of \"The Three Little Pigs\n",
