Dr. Oliver was delighted to see that the wolf's efforts were futile. \n\nThe wolf was very angry, but he was also very hungry. And so he asked Dr. Oliver if he had any siblings. The wolf knew full well that Dr. Oliver had many other siblings. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver's mother had a hundred little pigs. The wolf knew that Dr. Oliver was the 92nd little pig. \n\nDr. Oliver was not surprised that the wolf knew this. So he answered the wolf honestly when he said that yes, he did indeed have siblings. The wolf asked Dr. Oliver if he could have one of his siblings for dinner. Dr. Oliver knew where this was going. He knew that the wolf was going to try to find his siblings' homes and blow their homes down. \n\nDr. Oliver was not going to let that happen. He was going to do whatever it took to protect his siblings from the wolf. So he told the wolf that he would give him one of his siblings for dinner, but only if the wolf promised to leave the rest of his siblings. The wolf agreed to this. After all, one little pig was enough to keep the wolf full for a whole day. \n\nSo Dr. Oliver led the wolf to the home of his brother, Smith. The wolf was pleasantly surprised by how cooperative the little pig was being. The wolf had expected the little pig to be more difficult. But little did the wolf know, Smith was a very clever little pig. \n\nSmith had built his house out of lead. And there was absolutely no way that the wolf could get into a lead house or blow a lead house down. All such efforts were totally in vain. So the wolf huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but Smith's house stayed fully intact. The wolf was extremely frustrated and hungry, but he was also too hungry to roam elsewhere to look for another pig to eat. So he lay in a heap at the door of Smith's house. He cried out for food and his cries attracted a predator. \n",
