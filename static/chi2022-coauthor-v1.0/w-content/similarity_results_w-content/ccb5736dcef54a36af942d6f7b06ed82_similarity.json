        "sentence": "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\n\n\nYou look from the bee to all your wealth. Gold, glittering gems, pure and shimmering diamonds are piled high around you. Shiny coins slip through your fingers. Your eyes return to the bee. \"Build me the largest honey farm on Earth,\" you say. \"And tear this palace down. I never want to see it again. It bores me\"  You wave your hand and the bee flies away.\n\nThe bees follow their orders, tearing down the palace and building a honey farm. The honey farm produces more honey than ever before, and soon the bees are ordered to build a second huge honey farm, then a third.  The new palace, bigger and grander than before, is built. \n\nThe bees do exactly what you tell them to. But, one day, the bees come back and say \"Your Majesty, we have built the honey farms you ordered. We have enough honey to last the rest of your life, and beyond. You don't need us anymore. May we please have our freedom?\" \n\n\"That's very brave of you,\" you say. \"But I'm afraid that's not possible.\" You take a bite of honey and laugh. \"You see, I've decided to build a new palace.\" \"But, Your Majesty,\" the bees say. \"You have everything you need. Besides, you already have the largest palace in the world.\"\n\n\"The largest palace in the world,\" you say, \"isn't enough. I want the largest palace in the Multiverse. And you're going to build it for me.\"  You wave your scepter dismissively. \n\nThe bees look at each other, then back up at you. \"We're sorry it came to this, \" One of the bee says. She flies lightly over and stings you on your hand. \n\nYour body tenses up and your face turns red. Your eyes go wide and your tongue turns black. You fall to the ground, gripping your throat. You hear the bees laughing.  \"You pushed us too far,\" the same bee says. \"And now,, evil tyrant, you'll die.\" \n\nAs you lay dying, the bees' laughter slowly fades and the sound of nothingness  fills your ears. Perhaps you were wrong to enslave them and ask them for too much. \n",
