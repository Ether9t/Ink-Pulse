The giants who were in group A, later called as \"Super Giants\" because of their immense size, grew so high that they were over 1000 meters. They were so tall that they could easily walk on Mars without wearing oxygen masks. The Super Giants created their own cities on Mars where they could live peacefully. For the people in group B, they grew so tall that they could go to Earth by just floating.\n",
