But we need to gather data and information from reliable sources, preferably multiple sources so that we know whether or not something is factual or fake news. This way, we can then form well-rounded opinions and make informed decisions and be able to communicate and share our views with friends, family, and co-workers.\n\nWith today's technology, we are very lucky to have the access to all of the current news information that we need right at our fingertips. We can access current world, national, and local news with our computers, cell phones, and TVs. Everyone can form reasonable and logical stances on current events using these modern forms of technology. If you fail to do your part and stay current with the news then you have failed your civic duty as an American citizen.\n",
