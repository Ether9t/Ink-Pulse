Wee want to trade him for a female of our kind,\" he concluded. \"It iss a good trade.\" \n\nThe hammer-headed alien at the stall rubbing its chin as it mulled over what Svirrak was saying. Apparently satisfied the deal was a good one, it grunted then opened a cage. A green female with an eyestalk the size of her body emerged from the cage. \n\nThe alien pointed to the bundle behind Svirrak. \"Put the human in it\" the hammerhead said, gesturing to the now empty cage. \"We don't want it to bite us, we might get a disease\" it added.\n\nSvirrak took the human off his back, then dropped it into the cage. Matt Damon was quite angry. He had been lugged on the leathery back of an alien for hours, and was very hungry and thirsty. \n\n\"Do you know who I am?\" Matt shouted. \"I'm an Oscar winning actor in the film 'Good Will Hunting'. You're an alien with a freaking hammer on its head! You don't want to mess with me!\" Matt said, pointing at the hammerhead.\n\nThe alien just stared at him as he was dropped into the cage.

The hammerhead fell to the ground. \n\n\"This is the United States Airforce, leave the Matt Damon alone, and come out with your hands up!\" a voice shouted. Svirrak and the female alien looked at each other, then sighed as they raised their hands. \"We surrender\" Svirrak hissed.\n\nAs soon as the hammerhead aliens saw that the Airforce had arrived, they all raised their hands. The Airforce officers quickly rounded up the aliens and handcuffed them. \"You okay?\" The officer asked Matt Damon. \"We came as quickly as we could.\" \n\nMatt Damon stepped out of the cage and dusted himself off. \"My arm's a little sore, but I think I'm fine,\" he said. \"This is the 3rd time this month this has happened. I need to hire myself a bodyguard.\" \n\nThe officer nodded. \"We'll take you to the safety of Area 51. From there we'll get a helicopter to take you home. You can get some rest.\"\n",
