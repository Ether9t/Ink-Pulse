Koru will go away forever but the only way to eliminate him is to eradicate 10 countries. Riku doesn't want to cause any harm. Koru won't budge on his ultimatum.\n\nRiku comes up with a plan to trick Koru. He casts a fake spell that is supposed to eliminate 10 countries in the world. He then casts a spell that turns Koru into a plant before he can even realize that Riku didn't actually eliminate the 10 planets. Koru lives the rest of his life as a plant. Riku lives the rest of his life practicing magic and leaving a positive impact on everyone he comes into contact with.\n\nRiku was able to defeat his arch rival and also save the world. A beautiful first chapter to this series. However in the next book a more powerful and more evil force will challenge Riku. Will Riku be up to the challenge or will evil triumph over good? For the sake of humanity lets hope good beats evil just like the cliche says.\n",
