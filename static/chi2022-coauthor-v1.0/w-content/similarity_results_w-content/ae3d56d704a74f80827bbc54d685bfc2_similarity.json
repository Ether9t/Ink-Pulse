        "sentence": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, all these things have done is further complicate the already complicated and awkward process of attempting to have some kind of romantic interaction with someone you are attracted to. Since the dawn of time, people have managed to establish intimate relationships by meeting each other in real life, gradually learning to trust one another, and eventually being at the point to where they really want to begin a relationship with each other. 21st century technological developments have only added a layer of bizarre complexity to this process, and have further isolated people to the point where this process fails before it can even begin.\n\nDating apps are the greatest example of this. I've used them, and the experience is not unlike playing online poker, or playing video games — the main point of it is to kill time in lieu of having better things to do. The way the time killing process works with them, is that, you open up the app, conveniently right around the time you would otherwise go to bed, and start swiping through dozens of unappealing or phony users until you find one or two that you like, and begin exchanging messages with them, which might then end in a flaky or disconnected face-to-face interaction, which might then end in a crappy date that doesn't lead to anything further, which then leads you back to the beginning with yet more profiles of people you don't have anything in common with, and who you don't really want to meet. This does nothing to build a foundation of trust and rapport, and it does nothing to help people connect with each other.\n\nNetflix is a mere time waster, it's much like going to a video store, only with thousands of titles rather than hundreds, few of which either you or a prospective partner will have any interest in watching, and the whole process is more likely to result in awkward silence and resentment over poor viewing choices, than a romantic connection.  Texting is very much the same way — the only difference is that it sucks even more time out of your day, and takes more from your life, as you fail over and over to communicate with someone like a real human being, and wind up resorting to emoticons.\n\nWhat all of these things have in common, beyond being ineffectual for dating or relationships, is that they are all means for some greedy corporate entity to make money, and ultimately if you build a real relationship, the money making will stop, so they have interest in facilitating relationships. The best response is to ignore them all, and meet someone in the gym, library, a book store, coffee shop, or on a hiking trail somewhere. Then, once you're in a relationship, you can rest satisfied, knowing that not only have you met someone you might spend the rest of your life with, you've also saved a ton of money in the process and helped to put Netflix out of business.\n",
