When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.\n\nMorgan woke up that morning, listening to the sounds of the bunker as she drifted back into consciousness. The steady hum of the power generators, the quiet conversation of her fellow survivors, and a familiar loping thump as Herman ran by outside. It seemed like just any other day. But she knew it wasn't. It was time. \n\nShe got up and opened her door, which was something of a minor accomplishment these days. The last battle for New York...hadn't gone well. Down a leg, hand, and eye, as well as most of her friends, family, and, well, most of the human population. She didn't often bother, and when she did she felt like she was just in the way. Even the impromptu prosthetics Morgan had rigged up herself were more trouble than they were worth. But last week they have found something, and today was the day she would be allowed to try it out.\n\nIt had started with a supply party, just out looking for anything edible. But one of the kids - even kids played their part - stumbled onto an oddly shaped stone. And he said he felt something. Something he said was like a really strong tingle, but didn't hurt. And then an alien scout ship found them, and they thought they were all going to die. Right up to the moment the kid suddenly shot...something from his palms and blew the aliens all straight to hell. \n\nFrom there it was a mad dash back to the bunker, followed by days of hushed talk and whispered rumors. The kid could do things now, but he had almost no control over them. And people started talking about the old books, how all the little tricks people could do - light a candle, make a gift invisible, etc. - used to be real powers. So other people started touching the stone. And they started feeling things too. Some just felt things, others could make fire, and so on. Today was Morgan's turn. And there was a feeling that for her, it would be different. But it what way? Before...she was always a bit stronger with her tricks, powerful by the old standards.   But now...it as her missing hand that had held her power before, so what would happen?\n\nShe steeled herself and pushed the door open, glad to get out of her tiny room. One way or the other, she had to know. \n\nThe walk to the lab wasn't a long one (unless you were missing a leg, of course), but it felt like an eternity. It was conspicuously nearly empty. Was it to spare her feelings if nothing happened, or were they worried about what might happen if magic poured into such a damaged body?   Whatever the reason, Morgan was grateful not to have to worry about any other distractions. She ignored the one observer in the room, and walked straight to the stone. She didn't even need to touch it - the feeling was already coming. She reached out with her damaged arm, and a ghostly image of her former hand appeared. The stone suddenly glowed brightly as her hand connected, and a pulse of light flowed out.\n",
