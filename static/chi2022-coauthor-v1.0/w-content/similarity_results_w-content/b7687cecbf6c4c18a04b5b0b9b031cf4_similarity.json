All this mug was doing was making me question myself, but maybe that is why I am #1. Maybe I am because i am my toughest critic. Maybe I am because i am selfless and just want to make others happy. Maybe I am #1 because of how others think of me? Why cant i think of me the same way they do? Why cant i just enjoy this? I dont know the answer to any of these questions...but I hope to figure them out someday. I think i am almost ready to sit down and enjoy this cup of coffee.\n",
