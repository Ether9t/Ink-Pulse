        "sentence": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it is not selfish to engage in extreme sports, so long as the risk is only to one's self.   What is selfish is to inflict the risk on someone else, like your family, friends or even innocent bystanders.  However, this is extremely rare in the case of what I generally think of as \"extreme sports\", and is perhaps much more common in more traditional team sports or, especially, in auto racing.  \n\nThere is, of course, the question of whether or not this risk is acceptable, even in rare cases, but I would argue that spectators at auto races, and especially those who crowd around the dirt tracks at rally events, knowingly and willingly take on that risk.\n\nBack to the question at hand, I believe much of the danger is a result of what participants want from extreme sports.  Most of what I think of as extreme sports are a contest in which an individual pushes his or her own personal limits.  This could be on a skateboard in a stunt park, or on the side of a remote mountain.  In these cases, they are really only risking their own life and limb, and as long as they are prepared to pay the consequences, they should be allowed to do so.  \n\nHowever, it becomes selfish to the point of being dangerous when such risk forces others, who might not know better or be aware of the risks to pay some of the ultimate cost.  If an extreme athlete is uninsured, or has publicly provided health insurance, he or she is passing on the cost of any potential injury to the broader community.  You could make the case that even a fully-insured athlete is using hospital resources that might be better applied elsewhere, but I feel that this is not really salient.  If one were to take this position, we would have to consider children selfish every time they take a risk, and I am not willing to go that far.  It is the willful refusal (or inability) to pay for the consequences of one's actions that I consider to be selfish, and most extreme athletes do not engage in such conduct.  \n\nHowever, I am not willing to completely dismiss the notion that some sports are too dangerous to be considered sporting events at all.  One on one combat is a genre of sports that definitely comes close to, and sometimes crosses this line.  I would agree that athletes should be allowed to engage in boxing, wrestling, or other martial-arts contests that involve physical contact and serious risk of injury to themselves and to their counterpart, but only if they are fully aware of what they are doing.  Obviously, those under 18 or those who are not otherwise considered mentally-able to sign a contract should be barred from these sports for that reason.  And, of course, if someone chose to engage in combat sports without adequate ability to pay for potential injuries, I would consider that action to be selfish.  They are unduly burdening others in society for the sake of their own excitement.\n\nSo, yes, there are risks when engaging in extreme sports, but it is important to remember that there are risks in most sports and in most aspects of daily life.  I hope that my point has been clear, that others should be free to take these risks with their own bodies, and with the bodies of willing co-participants.  \n\nWhat would be selfish, would be forcing the risk of any kind of harm, including financial harm, on others who do not consent.  The true question, and the one that should be addressed in public policy, is how to stop this behavior from propagating among those who may not\n",
