You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" You looked around, but could not see anyone. The field you were standing on were empty, the only sight was the grass you were standing on under the clear blue sky above. Once again you heard a voice speak amongst the silence, \"Your Majesty, I await your orders.\" You look down, and see a little bee, no larger than a thumb, looking up at you from your shoulder. You feel shocked, not only has a bee landed on your shoulder, but it has talked to you as if you were royalty. You feel as if you are in a dream, but the bright sun shining on your skin makes it clear that you are wide awake. You speak out loud, \" Who are you?\", in a confused tone of voice.\n\nThe little bee replies, \"I am your loyal servant, I am here to serve you, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Surely you have a name,\" you replied back to the bee claiming to be your servant.\n\n\"I do, but I am not allowed to speak it, Your Majesty.\"\n\nYou ponder in your head why speaking their name would not be allowed, but decide against it. You then speak, \" Are their others who wish to serve as my servants?\"\n\nThe little bee replies, \"Yes, Your Majesty, there are many who wish to serve you, but I am the first to arrive.\"\n\nYour head begins to fill with many racing thoughts, of what you can do with hundreds, maybe thousands of servants at your command. You then proclaim, \"Tell them to arrive to my quarters, for it shall be their new home.\"\n\nAs the little bee flies off, you feel a strange feeling of joy, as if you have just gained something you've always wanted. You would have companionship, and will overcome your fear of being stung. When once bees were a source of fear due to your allergies, your loyal servants would not sting you out of respect for you. You begin to walk back to your quarters, and when you arrive, you see hundreds of bees, all with a smile on their face. As their queen, they expect commands to ensure your protection, and you would be happy to be their queen as long as they protect you. From that moment on you would be royalty, a human commanding hundreds of loyal bees, and in time you would forget that you were ever allergic to bees. For the bees that served you would protect you from other foreign bees, \n",
