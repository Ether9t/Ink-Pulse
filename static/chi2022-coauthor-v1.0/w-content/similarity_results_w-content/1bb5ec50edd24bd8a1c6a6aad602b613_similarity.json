I love the feel of a book, the smell of the pages, and the ability to highlight and make notes in the margins.   There is a sense of permanence and ownership that is exhilarating. I feel a sense of connection with the author, one that is not present in audiobooks. \n\nRelaxing with a good book is an experience.  You can get comfortable, curl up in a beanbag, without getting overstimulated, or needing an electronic device like an audiobook needs. \n\nI love the ability to read a book at my own pace, and not have to worry about missing something if I stop listening.
