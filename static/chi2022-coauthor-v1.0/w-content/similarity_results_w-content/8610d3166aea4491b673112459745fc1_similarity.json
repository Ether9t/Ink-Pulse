Mana Knights are also able to use Mana to enhance their physical abilities, such as strength and speed. \n\nMana Knights can also use Mana to create magical weapons and armor. These items are called \"Mana Tools\" and are the only weapons that can harm the aliens. Mana Knights are also able to create magical barriers, which are called \"Mana Shields\". \n\nMana Knights are able to use Mana to heal themselves and others. They are also able to use Mana to create portals to other dimensions, and to travel through time. \n\nThe Mana Knights are led by the Mana Knight Commander, who is the strongest Mana Knight. The Mana Knights are also led by a council of elders, who are the strongest Mana Knights in each of the four elements.  There are preparations being made for war with the aliens. The  knights are preparing to overthrow the alien slavers, and free the rest of the humans.  \n\nYou have been hearing the whispers of the Mana Goddess since your 16th Birthday. Today is your choosing ceremony, but you are still undecided.  Each of the elements has a special appeal to you, but they all have benefits. \nEarth is the element of strength and power.  Water is fluid and agile.  Wind is high and mighty.  Fire is quick and energetic. You can see yourself in each element. \n\nYou must dedicate one element as your specialty. How will you ever choose one?\n\n",
