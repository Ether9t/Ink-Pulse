He was utterly defeated and exhausted from waiting for so long just to be disappointed. \n\nThe wolf decided to go search for a tool that could cut through anything. The wolf searched far and wide for such a tool and eventually found something. He found a laser gun so powerful that it could even cut through steel, let alone uranium. The wolf was pleased and begin to move the laser to the pig's house. He prepared to fire it when all of a sudden the pig appeared outside and deployed a laser prove shield against the wolf. Again, the wolf was defeated and proceeded to crawl back to his lair where he would hatch up another plan. \nThe wolf went searching for a way to get around the laser defense shield and ended up finding a grenade launcher. He fired the gun at the house to blow it up and eat the pig. Too bad the pig had deployed a bounce-back mechanism that launched the grenades back at the wolf. \n\nThe wolf would be killed finally on that day by the smartest pig among them. Pig number 92 would live on as the champion of Pigville. The story of Pig number 92 was written by a famous piggy poet. It described his adventures with the wolf and his overall success in killing him. The moral of this story was really that there is always someone smarter out there and even determination cannot always be the deciding factor in who wins. This story was written to teach children the power of education. \n",
