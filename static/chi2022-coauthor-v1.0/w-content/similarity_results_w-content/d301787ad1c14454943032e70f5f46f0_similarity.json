You are allergic, so you begin to become a little nervous. Moments later, many more bees swarm around you. The bees all come to a still motion, still flying but not moving back and forth. A little bee lands on your shoulder and says \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\". You swat at the bees, but they fly back to their original formation. What is going on? You can't stop thinking about the man in the trench coat and fedora. What did he do to me? Why did he say I was a queen and all my dreams would come true? The bees all start laughing. \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" they say. \"Why are you all calling me majesty?\" I asked the bees. \"Because you are the queen of course! We're your servants and we will do anything for you. How can you not know this?\" They say. \"What do I have to do to get you all off of me?\" \"I am a man, i can not be a queen\" I exclaimed. \"You are a queen, and all of this is your kingdom. So what is your order?\" The bees say. \"Okay, i will think about it.\" I say to the bees. \"We will be waiting on your command.\" they reply. \"My first request is for you guys to leave me alone\" I say to them. The bees all get in a single file line and turn their backs to me. After this the bees alll huddle into a corner, sit on their butts and say nothing. \"What are you guys doing?\" I asked. \"We are leaving you alone your majesty\" they replied. \"Now, what is you next order?\" they said. \"I need to know if this is real or not.\" I said.\n",

        "sentence": "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees. You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand. Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\n\nAs you're standing in line at the grocery store, a man in a trench coat and fedora walks up to you. He says \"I'm going to make you a queen, and all your dreams will come true.\" The man vanishes before you can reply. How can i be a queen when i am a man? More important than that, what am I the queen of? You walk outside and start to hear a buzzing noise as you get closer to your car. All of a sudden you can see a bee flying around you. You are allergic, so you begin to become a little nervous. Moments later, many more bees swarm around you. The bees all come to a still motion, still flying but not moving back and forth. A little bee lands on your shoulder and says \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\". You swat at the bees, but they fly back to their original formation. What is going on?

One of the bees flys over, and stings me on the nose. Just as this happens, I wake up in my bedroom.\n",
