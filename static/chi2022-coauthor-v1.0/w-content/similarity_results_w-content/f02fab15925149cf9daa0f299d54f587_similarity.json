I told the bear I was just after the evil queen and I wouldn't take any of the honey so he let me go. I told the bear if he would help me, I bet the bees would give him some honey and the little bee in the suit agreed. So the bear agreed to help me catch the evil queen. \n\nThe third obstacle was a giant tree.\n",
