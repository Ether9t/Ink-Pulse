You're forced to use your wits to defeat the increasingly monstrous attackers. You're aided by the fact that the majority of the population has become too degenerate to use weapons and technology, and also by the fact that they're deteriorating mentally, so they're unable to coordinate attacks.\n\nThe battle wages, and the progress on the serum escalates, but you're getting closer and closer to being overrun. The attacker's numbers are too much, and you're too weak, and many of you have already died. With days left before the drug will be complete, some of the attackers penetrate the base, and you barely manage to capture a few. With your ranks dwindling, the drug is complete, and along with volunteers from your own ranks, you decide to try injecting them with the drug too.\n\nThe drug works, and a number of you are growing younger, and stronger. However, as this happens, they're experiencing the same mental degeneration as the attackers. The attackers who are injected, meanwhile, are rapidly aging, but their degeneration has been reversed. Together, you and they strike a delicate balance between age and youth, intelligence and savagery, and join together to perfect an improved version of the serum, one that can be used to restore people to normalcy, and with that, restore the hope of the survival of humanity.\n",
