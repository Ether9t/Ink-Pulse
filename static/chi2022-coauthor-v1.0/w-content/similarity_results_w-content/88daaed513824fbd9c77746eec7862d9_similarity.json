        "sentence": "Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. 50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation. \n\nIt seemed foolish of the U.S to not verify that the other countries were isolating, but the passing through of borders was strictly prohibited. The U.S. government decided to send a special task force to find out what happened to the other countries. The task force is sent through the border and discovers that the other countries have been destroyed by a nuclear war. The task force is then ambushed by a group of survivors, who are revealed to be the descendants of the people who survived the nuclear war. \n\nThe survivors are led by a man named Kincaid, who is the leader of a religious cult that worships the nuclear war.
