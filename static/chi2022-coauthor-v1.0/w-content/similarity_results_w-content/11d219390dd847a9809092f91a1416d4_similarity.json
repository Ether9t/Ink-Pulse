Since everyone else in the room seems to be passed out from boredom, your choice becomes the reality of the new you. You love what you are now doing for a living, and for the first time in your life, you feel satisfied with your lot.\n\nThen you decide to play the lottery. Something you hadn't really done before. The winning numbers are called, and they belong to the new you. What a sweet surprise. So much money all at once, you can do anything. A new house, a new car, vacations. You quit your job and begin to spend endless days on vacation and shopping and basically lounging about. But is this life really any better? Shouldn't you be doing more with all the money you have? You tell yourself that it's okay because you have the money now to help people who need it. That's it! Helping those in need. This is something you have always wanted to do in your past lives, but never had the money or time to do it. \n\nSuddenly, you notice movement in the theater. All of your selves are now paying attention and ready to make choices about who you will help with your money. The old versions of you all had different problems. Health, relationship, living situations. Now is the time for you to give to organizations that could have helped in the past. You give money to a few different organizations, vowing to personally help the people they cater to. One by one, the suggestions for where you should donate money to come in. You watch as the new you writes checks, volunteers time, and raises awareness for each and every group that needs help. You can see that the new you is truly happy and filled with joy to be able to help others. It is as if you have finally found your purpose and achieved your true self.\n\n The screen begins to dim and the lights in the theater come up. Everyone claps. You all know this version of you will be the best yet.\n",
