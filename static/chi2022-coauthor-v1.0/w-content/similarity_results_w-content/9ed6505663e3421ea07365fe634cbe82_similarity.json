When the team gets on board, they encounter all kinds of alien security and must use their own methods to get through. There are many new traps and a couple of soldiers get killed pretty quickly because of them. It becomes a matter of preserving the rest of the team at one point since there were very few left. \n\nFinally, they locate Matt in the secure ritual chamber where they are preparing to extract his brain matter. They have to fight their way down the long hallway filled with alien soldiers and traps. It becomes apparent that they may not survive this encounter. It is a hard-fought battle, but in the end, they make it to Matt. They release him from the shackles and begin to look for an exit. All of a sudden, a massive security robot shows up with flamethrowers. It is the \"biggest and baddest\" robot they have ever encountered. The captain instructs the team to run the other way and they do end up finding a ventilation shaft to escape through. It becomes apparent if they let Matt be taken again there may not be another chance to rescue him. He is worth too much to humanity and the devastation that would follow his capture would be unimaginable.\n\nThe team flys home and celebrate the victory with a grain of salt. They explain to the president that they must get Matt in to a maximum security safe house so this does not happen again. The president agrees and they begin to prepare for his transport.\n",
