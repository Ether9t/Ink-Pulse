The alien's name is Soeurette and she is determined to marry Matt no matter what, because she has fallen in love with him. She has kidnapped Matt and taken him to her home planet, and has been trying to convince him to marry her. Matt is totally uninterested in Soeurette's advances and keeps telling her to let him go, but Soeurette is delusional and thinks that Matt is in love with her and is just playing hard to get. \n\nSoeurette is a very determined alien, and she is not going to give up on her love for Matt. She has been trying to convince Matt to marry her for a long time, and she is not going to give up on him that easily. She finally decides to tell him that she is pregnant to force Matt's hand at marriage.

Matt sends a radio signal to planet Earth to let everyone know that he needs to be rescued immediately from Soeurette's planet, which is named \"Zorba\". Immediately, human forces are mobilized and a rescue platoon is sent into space to bring Matt back to Earth. Soeurette, of course, is not going to let Matt go without a fight. She is determined to keep Matt on her planet, and she is determined to keep him as her husband. In fact, she has already started wedding planning and has already booked a cake tasting, a caterer, a wedding menu designer, a dress tailor, and a wedding photographer.\n\nMatt is feeling increasingly annoyed by Soeurette, since she is not taking no for an answer. He also knows he cannot possibly have gotten Soeurette pregnant, \n",
