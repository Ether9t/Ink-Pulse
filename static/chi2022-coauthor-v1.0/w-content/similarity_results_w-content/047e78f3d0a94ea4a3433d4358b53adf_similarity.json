She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.\n\nOne day, she is getting ready for a date and is distracted by a scratching at the door. She opens the door to find a cat. It is a Russian Blue and she thinks it is a male because it is big and seems dominant. She decides to name it “He-Man” because of its size and attitude.\n\nShe decides to take it with her on her date, but the cat is not happy. She arrives at the restaurant to meet her date, and places the cat's chair on another chair at her table. The cat jumps up on the chair and begins to walk around it, and then jumps down and walks around the table.\n\nNow she gets it: He-Man is a Hungry-Man.\n\nThe woman is very upset that her date is late, and she is also upset that the cat is not happy. She asks the waiter for a piece of broiled chicken and, when it comes, she offers it to the cat. The cat eats it and then jumps up on the chair again.\n\nBY this time her date is over an hour late. She decides to order as she is hungry. She orders a steak, and when it comes, she offers it to the cat. After a few more minutes, the waiter approaches, carrying a small white envelope. He hands it to her and says, “This was delivered for you sometime yesterday.”\n\nShe opens it and removes a small piece of paper. It reads:\n\nBy the time you read this, you might be thinking that I stood you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am here and I am sitting in the cat's chair.\n\nThe woman is dumbfounded.
