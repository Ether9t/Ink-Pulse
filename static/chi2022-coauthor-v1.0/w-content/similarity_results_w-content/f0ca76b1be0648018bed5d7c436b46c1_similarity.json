If we do not speak for them, nobody will. \n\nI think that people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals because they are not as complex as humans. It is easier to relate to the suffering of animals. Humans are more complex and it is harder to relate to them. Human interactions have ambiguity. Is the striking in self-defense, spanking, liberation of a country's people or oil, retaliation for cheating? There's many more questions and contexts to human-on-human violence, than human-on-animal. \n\nThere's a large body of social context to animal empathy.  Nearly every culture has been taught to fear \"outsiders\" or other countries. It is easier to fear a stranger than it is to empathize with them.  With animals, many societies view them as lesser beings, tools or objects that we own. It is easier to empathize with something that we own than it is to empathize with a stranger.  We can all feel the loss when something we own is damaged. \n\nThe complexity of the humans is the key difference. Humans widely accept animals as food, or clothing. But any other useless or senseless violence is more easy to be seen as just that: unneeded abuse.  With humans, there's a cloud of uncertainty that lingers of many interpersonal actions, and this makes all the difference. \n",
