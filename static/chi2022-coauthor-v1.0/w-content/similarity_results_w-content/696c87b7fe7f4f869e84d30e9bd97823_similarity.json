Dwarven siege engines and other primitive devices of destruction are even more effective against the aliens, and a dwarf trebuchet manages to, for the first time, bring down an alien ship.\n\nAfter that, the goblins and other darker magical creatures begin to stir. Though long enemies of both man, and the other magical beings, they join forces with the other survivors to fight the alien menace, and their poison darts wreak havoc among the ranks of the alien troops. Finally, the dragons, the oldest of all magical creatures, awaken from their slumber.

The mere presence of the creatures often makes the most battle-hardened alien warriors flee in terror. Meanwhile, the humans begin to discover their own latent magical abilities.
