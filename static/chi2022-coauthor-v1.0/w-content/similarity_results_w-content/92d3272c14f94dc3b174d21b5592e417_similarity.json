Would you ever not watch or read something because of its offensive portrayal of someone?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, stereotypes such as the \"dumb blonde\" or the \"loud black woman\" are offensive because they are not only offensive to the people they represent, but also to the intelligence of the reader or viewer of that media. They not only fail to capture the nuance of human behavior, but also represent a lack of creativity and a lack of effort on the part of the writer or director. So, I might not want to read or watch something because of the stereotypes existing in it, but my reasons for that are at least as much due to the lack of creativity and effort on the part of the writer or director as they are due to the stereotypes themselves. In short, stereotypes are something that tends to be employed by bad writers.\n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily the case with stereotypes found in some works that were created a long time ago. These characters that have become hackneyed and stereotypical in modern use,  might have been fresh and new when they were first created, and even created by people who were trying to do something new and different, or be as accurate as possible in their portrayal of a group of people. Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now.\n",
