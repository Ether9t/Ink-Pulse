This agreement would protect both the bees and the allergic man and his family. The bees would have a home and the allergic man could continue on with his life without worrying about being stung. This was a fair agreement and had a winning situation for both sides. The bees reluctantly agreed on the truce. The allergic man and his family were relieved to be able to live free of worry. They fenced off the area and let the bees live in peace. This went on for many years to come until the great war of 2050. As the bees grew in number, and as they were a part of the family now, they knew there was something that would threaten their way. They decided to strike the family and kill half of all people.
