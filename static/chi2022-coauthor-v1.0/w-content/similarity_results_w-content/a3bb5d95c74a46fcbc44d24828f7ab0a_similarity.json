        "sentence": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, I think technology has a great impact on dating, and not just dating but in general just meeting new people. Whether its for dating or just trying to hang out with people. I have met a lot of friends that became real life friends, by playing online video game.\n\nAs far as dating, it really helps you to put yourself out there to meet people who are looking for the same thing as you, and often times have the same interests as you. Not to mention it speeds up the process of finding a date, or a potential partner.\n\nI do have experience with dating and technology. As a matter of fact, I met my wife through a dating website and app. I don't think we would have met otherwise. We both had the same interests and hobbies, and we were both looking for someone to share our lives with. So we found each other, dated for awhile, and ended up getting married a couple of years later. Still happy also. \n\nOther technology can also have a great impact on any type of relationship also. Every sit back on the couch at night with your sweet heart and just relax while watching Netflix? Yup, that's using technology in your relationship. It can also help you understand your partner better as well. Maybe you want to surprise your partner with a gift. Get out your smartphone and order it online from Amazon or something. Again, technology just made your life a little easier. \n\nTechnology can also be a great way to keep in touch with your partner. Through messaging apps you can still communicate while away from each other, to let each other know you both still care.\n\nI think technology has a great impact on dating, and relationships in general. I support it.\n",
