You can see their pictures, read their profile, see what they like and dislike all while talking to them in real time. I realize that you feelings may all change when you meet in person but its still much more efficient then trying to find people in person. The algorithms used to match people are also getting better and better as time goes and the tools that go along with them. \nWhile I realize dating apps are not for everyone, but they are useful to most. They are much better at finding you a mate then your are in a personal setting. Not just a little better but several orders of magnitude better. I personally will never try the old ways again.\n",
