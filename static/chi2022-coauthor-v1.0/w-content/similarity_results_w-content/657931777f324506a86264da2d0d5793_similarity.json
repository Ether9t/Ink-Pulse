I would like you to do my bidding,\" I said. \n\n\"I shall do whatever you command,\" said the bee.\n\n\"One more question though.

After all, why would I believe a tiny bee could talk? \n\nA few days later, I was stung by a bee. I was fine.  I didn't die.  It just stung a little bit.  The bee died, but it didn't talk this time.  \n",
