I believe that this knowledge is more important know then ever before. The world is changing so fast and the ability to think critically and logically is more important than ever. From cable news to social media to your family, its hard to know who is right and wrong and it is critical that we know how to figure that out. Understanding the difference between objective facts and personal facts is key to navigating this new social order we find ourselves in. I think the recent disconnect from facts on the election and the pandemic goes to show how important it is to know what is true and what is not. It also shows how many people truly are misinformed and how much impact it has on the health and well being of a society. This is why I believe that learning logic and reasoning skills is the most important thing to be learned in school today. \n",
