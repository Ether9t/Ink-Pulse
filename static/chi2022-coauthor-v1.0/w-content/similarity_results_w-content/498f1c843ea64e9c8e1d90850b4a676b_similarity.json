It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nI thought to myself \"Uh what? I thought JFK was dead\" and I brushed it off as a prank. \n\nI woke up the next morning and found ANOTHER letter from JFK, this time with a phone number on it. I looked at the number, and my jaw dropped. It was the White House. So then I knew someone from the White House was playing a prank on me. I called the number and they asked me \"Are you Barack Obama?\" and I replied \"Yeah, why?\" and they said, \"Well...we need you to come down and meet with us today.\" I said, \"Ok?\". \n\nThat day I went down to the white house and they took me to a big meeting room with a bunch of people in suits. They sat me down and said, \"Mr. Obama, we have a problem.\" I said, \"What kind of problem?\" and they told me about the time machine. I said, \"What time machine?\" and they told me about the JFK time machine. They went on and explained how JFK built a time machine in the 1960s, and that he had traveled to the future (2016) to get me to be president. \n\n\nThe Government was in a crisis and weren't doing their job, so JFK went back to the future to find someone who could lead this country. So I said, \"What exactly do you want me to do?\" and they told me that as President, I have the power to travel back in time and inform JFK to not go to Dallas.
