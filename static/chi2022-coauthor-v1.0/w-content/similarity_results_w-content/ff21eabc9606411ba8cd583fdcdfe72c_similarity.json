The future will be in the hands of the children. \n\nThe children decide to do things differently from their parents. They will make a new set of rules. No one will be allowed to have more than they need. Everyone will have a nice house. Everyone will have fun. Everyone will have clean water to drink. It's simple. It's fair. They called it Utopia. \n\nThe children do as they said they would. For a time, Utopia was the greatest place on earth. Everyone always had everything they needed. Now the oldest children were growing up and becoming adults. They were getting grouchy and not wanting to have fun anymore. They stopped following the rules of Utopia. Some of them started to eat all the food themselves and didn't share it with anyone. They wanted to make rules about who can have clean water. Who can have nice houses. The kids of Utopia decided enough was enough. They went to war against the adults. The war did not last long, because the kids realized they were against war. They did not fight. The adults ended up fighting themselves and dying out by the end of the year. And the kids reigned on.\n",
