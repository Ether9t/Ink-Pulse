        "sentence": "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly. It seemed like a series of pranks that were trendy at first. Over time it became abundantly clear that, this was no prank, this was really happening. What could cause such worldwide phenomena? It turns out the government had been infiltrated by aliens. Aliens being logical as they are decided to make a few logical changes, starting with the simple truths, like the countless mugs denoting #1. This was highly illogical. \n\nIt was soon discovered that the aliens were absolutely averse to the little things that humans enjoy, the emotional things. Things such as love, happiness, and joy. All of these things were absolutely useless to the aliens and they saw them as something that needed to be wiped out. \n\nThough the #1 Dad mugs changing was perhaps the first sign that people woke up to, there were many others. The aliens were making logical changes to our lives left and right. They changed everyone's social security numbers and reordered them starting from a single digit 1. All these changes started to cause utter chaos in society. \n\nIt was soon discovered that the aliens were not from space at all. They actually came from a quantum computing facility, or more accurately, a dimension that this technology tapped into. The aliens were from a world where logic was everything. The fate of humanity fell into the hands of one brave man who led a group of rebels to try to thwart the alien's plans by sending logic back into their dimension. It was discovered that the aliens were not simply averse to illogical, emotional things, it was like poison to them. \n\nThe rebels went to the alien's dimension and were able to sabotage their supercomputer nexus by uploading the entirety of humanity's memes onto it. The sheer variety and volume of the meme content caused the nexus to explode, destroying the alien dimension and the portal that was opened to it.\n",
