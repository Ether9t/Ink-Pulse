Russia seems to have taken over everything. The United States is in a state of shock, and with their military badly depleted by the long isolation, they are completely unprepared to take on the new Russian Empire.\n\nRussian forces march in to Washington DC, and Vladimir Putin Jr becomes the new American President, appointing Donald Trump Jr Jr as his Veep.\n\nThe US is divided into the \"Russian Empire\", which spans from Maine to Miami, and the People’s Republic of California, and the \"Other Russian Empire,\" comprising the left part.\n\nWith American resistance at an end, the rest of the world becomes rather peaceful for the first time. The world is now united under a single banner: The Russian Empire. Peace reigns.\n\nBut this is no ordinary peace. It is the peace of despair, the peace of surrender. Russian thugs roam unchecked. They are the only ones with access to firearms, and they use them to suppress the people. The people have little choice but to accept this. They are too tired to do anything, and they have no guns. People are forced to live under the most humiliating conditions, with a Russian soldier at their door every week to collect cash.\n\nThen, finally, the people begin to rise.

When Russian soldiers show up for their weekly collection, they are garroted on the spot and their weapons seized. Donald Trump Jr Jr strangles Putin in the Oval office and takes over.
