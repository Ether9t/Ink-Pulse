        "sentence": "What Are the Most Important Things Students Should Learn in School?\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, the most important thing to teach students is a love of learning and to be curious, and to ask questions.  If this can be taught to students everything else will follow, math, science, English, social studies, critical thinking.  Many classes and school are uninspiring,   boring, and not challenging.  This makes it hard for students to learn anything, and drives them away from school.  If education can be engaging and fun student will want to attend and be involved.   I have learned that if you want to learn something, you have to be interested in it.  What we want from people, to be good citizens, you need to be a life long learner, and you need to be curious.  The more information people absorb, the more they analyze what is going on around then, and the more people study how things have happened before, the more they can contribute to society.  Even as I approach middle age I feel like I am still learning every day, I have learned that you can never stop learning, and that the more you learn the more you realize how much there is to learn.  If this were the foundation stone of school, the first building block , the rest of the curriculum would fall into place.  I know teachers struggle with students who are not interested, and I know this can have a detrimental impact on a class and other students, but if you can get a student interested in something they will want to learn more.  Therefore, I firmly believe this is the most important thing that students should learn when in school.\n",
