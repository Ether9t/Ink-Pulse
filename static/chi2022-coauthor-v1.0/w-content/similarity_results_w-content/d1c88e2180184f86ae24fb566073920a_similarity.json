        "sentence": "Should College Athletes Be Paid?\n\nDo you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?\n\nIn “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,\" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\"\n\nDo you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, I think college students should not be paid for playing sports. I believe that college athletes should be paid in the form of a scholarship. I think it is inegalitarian to pay college athletes because it would be unfair to the other students who are not athletes. Everyone deserves reward and merit for their hard work. It is unfair that students that don't play sports have to struggle to pay for college while the athletes get a free ride. I also believe that sports are unsafe and it is not fair to pay college athletes because they could get seriously injured. There are students studying medical sciences and healthcare, and are trained to help injured athletes. These students are not rewarded fairly for this.  They on to live stressful lives with lots of debt, while athletes are rewarded with a free ride. This is why I believe that college athletes should not be paid.\n",

They should learn the lessons of life planning and  budgeting just like everyone else. And at the end of the day, sports are just games and they don't matter.\n",
