        "sentence": "What Are the Most Important Things Students Should Learn in School?\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most important things students should learn in school? What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, students should learn computer science and technology skills. Technology is changing increasingly rapidly today, and there are a lot of tools for people to learn and use to get what they want. Knowledge of these new technologies can help people understand what is happening, how they will benefit, and why they should use certain tools to get the desired things. \n\nI have personally benefitted from technology class the most. I learned the basics of programming, like HTML and Python, which I have been able to write codes that I use to help me to automate many tasks I perform in my finance job. I spend a lot of time in front of a computer screen at work, and I wanted to reduce my manual tasks to free up my time. I was able to write a tool that imports Excel spreadsheets and builds SQL databases based on the table structure. I then run data queries against those databases to get the results I want, and it has saved me a lot of time. \n\nI have received recognition for the success of my tool, and was able to license it to the company I work for.  In addition, I was selected from my company to participate in its Intrapreneurship program, working on software services for small businesses. The passion instilled in me by my first technology classes has driven me to continue exploring the technology field.  It has saved me time, made me money, set me on the path to promotions, and, above all, let me efficiently collaborate with others so that I can do work that I love, as a rising star in the field. \n\nTechnology classes are so flexible, and technology so ubiquitous, there is virtually no industry that is not impacted by technology at all.\nLearning computer sciences prepares you for an easier life, gives you confidence in nearly every field, and, in my opinion,  technology and comp sci is the most important class any student can take!\n",
