        "sentence": "Should College Athletes Be Paid?\n\nDo you think college athletes should be paid? Or is a college scholarship and other non-monetary perks like the opportunity to play in front of cheering fans enough?\n\nIn “Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports,\" Cody J. McDavis writes: “Paying student-athletes might sound like a fairer way to treat students who generate so much money and attention for their colleges (not to mention the television networks that broadcast their games). But paying athletes would distort the economics of college sports in a way that would hurt the broader community of student-athletes, universities, fans and alumni. A handful of big sports programs would pay top dollar for a select few athletes, while almost every other college would get caught up in a bidding war it couldn't afford.\"\n\nDo you find his argument persuasive? What possible difficulties or downsides might there be in providing monetary compensation to players?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, college athletes are definitely needed to be compensated for their efforts and for their contributions to the success of their teams. The money that flows through these colleges are vast enough that extra compensation does not harm any of the parties involved: the players, the colleges and the television networks. It's very manipulative and very cruel to deny athletes the well-deserved monetary compensation. There's also no real evidence to support that it would cripple the economics of college sports as claimed by Cody J. McDavis in his article \"Paying Students to Play Would Ruin College Sports\".\n\nBecause here's the thing. If you demand someone to do something for you, it's only right to compensate him/her for the act he/she committed. Not granting them any compensation is a form of slavery and exploitation. These college athletes have worked their bodies to the absolute limit, tearing their tendons and sustaining all sorts of damages, but at the end of the day, they do all that for just a piece of paper that says they are college graduates. \n\nWe need to properly compensate college athletes so that this will help decrease the number of kids who are simply just grinding and not get any monetary pay-off. The funds going in these college sports are nowhere near the little size they were years ago, owing to the shortsightedness of the last two generations. The world has changed, and how these schools are taking money in is very much outdated. We should not enrich those CEO's or those salaries of Deans or who ever owns the colleges, what we need to do instead is to put a stop to the exploitation of college athletes by compensating them for the work they have been doing all their lives.\n\nSure, an athlete with great foundation and great performance during their plays on tournaments would definitely earn them proper and high-paying careers in the future.

We need to hold those CEOs who own those college athletes accountable for their ill actions and to stop exploiting college athletes in their quest for profit.\n",
