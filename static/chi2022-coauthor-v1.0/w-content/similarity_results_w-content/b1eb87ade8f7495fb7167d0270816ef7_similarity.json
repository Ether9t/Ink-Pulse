They know that people from Earth will soon show up to rescue him. They begin trying to find the clone that is the closest to the real Matt Damon. They will then send that one back to Earth and announce to the world that Matt Damon has been found.\n\nThey find one that is close. He is a little too smart and not charming enough but he'll do. So they dress him up as Matt Damon and send him back to Earth in an escape shuttle. Earth is very happy to have him back and cancel the rescue mission. \n\nAll is well for a little while. However, subpar Matt Damon movies begin coming out on Earth. No one is sure what is off about them. They just don't seem to be the same. People just put up with his new lackluster movies out of a sense of duty. \n\nMeanwhile the real Matt Damon is making movies for the aliens of space. They are huge hits and he enjoys being an intergalactic celebrity. He gets along with the aliens and enjoys his life. Sometimes he'll request that they kidnap a co-star for one of his movies but in general he just has fun working with upcoming alien actors.\n",
