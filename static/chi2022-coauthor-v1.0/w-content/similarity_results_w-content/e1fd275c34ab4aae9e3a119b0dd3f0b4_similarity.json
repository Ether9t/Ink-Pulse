        "sentence": "Is It Selfish to Pursue Risky Sports Like Extreme Mountain Climbing?\n\nSome sports, like extreme mountain climbing, are dangerous. Since there are varying degrees of risk in most, if not all, sports (such as the possibility of concussions, broken bones and even death), how does one decide where the line might be drawn between what is reasonable and what is not? Are some sports simply too dangerous to be called a sport?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, I think some sports are too dangerous to be called a sport. I am not saying sports athletes are not brave, but I think some sports athletes would try to do something that would guarantee harm. It should be clear what makes the activity a sport. That poses the question, what makes something a sport?\n\nThere are four main questions to consider when trying to pull something from being a sport: the athlete, the competitor, spectators and equipment. But what about intention? It is the intention that makes the sport, not the consequences. What is the goal of the activity? \n\nAlso, the history of the sport has a lot to do with if something should be considered a sport or not. For example, Sumo wrestling is a sport because it has been around for a very long time. It is very much a part of Japanese heritage. On the other hand, parkour , which is more of a stunt sport, is only about twenty years of age. Having little to no history makes it hard to say if the activity is a sport. It is more of a fad that could disappear in no time. Is skateboarding a sport? This is never heard of before the 1960s. Now, it is extremely popular. In my opinion, parkour and skateboarding is more about being cool more than it is a sport.\n\nThe people who do a sport is also important. They should be of the highest caliber, including physical ability and character as well. If a person is too risky and too ambitious, these are not the kinds of people who would end up in a sport. A good athlete is a responsible, safe, and upstanding member of the community. Sportsmen are not arrogant, and do not use violence. They should have a positive influence on their fans, and not encourage or promote risky behavior.\n",
