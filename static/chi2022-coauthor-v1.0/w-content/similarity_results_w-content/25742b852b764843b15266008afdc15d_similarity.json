Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nYou order the bee to get off you, and it does so.  You are relieved for a moment, but then you notice the buzzing sound from around your other ear.\n\n\"I'll stay off your shoulder,\" she says.  \"What, may I ask, are your orders?\"\n\nThere is a long pause as you try to think of something to say.  You are normally terrified of bees, and you want to get as far away from this one as possible, but you stop to think for a minute.  \n\nIf one bee listens to you, maybe they all will.   If you ask her to leave, will they all leave you alone?  If this one leaves, will others come instead?  Will they all be as eager to listen?\n\nWhat do you say to her?  You don't want to waste this opportunity, but you don't want it to backfire on you, either.  \n\n\"Will all the other bees listen to you if I pass on orders?\" you ask?\n\n\"I know they will,\" she responds.\n\n\"Okay, then, here are my orders: gather up your compatriots and fly away as far as you can.  In fact, I hear Minnesota is nice.  Go by Old Man Johnson's Farm\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't move to Minnesota.  It is too far for us to fly on our own\"\n\n\"Then how far can you go?\"\n\n\"We can make it to the other side of the county, out in the desert if we really push ourselves\"\n\n\"Then I order you to go there.  Take all of the bees with you.  If I never hear from you again, I will know that you have followed me orders successfully.  However, if I hear one of you buzzing around me again, I will be very angry\"\n\nYou have a feeling that she's going to follow through on her promise, and you feel satisfied.\n\nFor the rest of the day, you don't see or hear another bee.  You feel safe, finally.\n\nYou can finally stop and smell the flowers, both literally and figuratively, without having to worry about those pesky pollinators flying out and stinging you.  You've never felt better in your life.\n\nYou spend most of the day in the park, enjoying nature without a care in the world.  \n\nAs the sun sets, you decide to make your way back home.  \n\nYou head back to the bike rack, find your bicycle chained up where you left it, and crouch down.\n\nYou reach into your pants pocket to get your keys, and your hand hits something unexpected.  Furthermore, to your horror, you hear a scream!  \n\nYou look around you, and there is no one around, and yet, that scream you just heard sounded like your own voice!  \n\nYou try to shake it off, and pretend that you were just hearing things, but as you pull out your keys, you see a large, dead bee stuck to the key ring.\n\nNervously, you manage to stutter out, \"Your Majesty...I presume?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n",
