Other students in school would never know about it either, which gives the bullies less ammo to use against students in poverty. Obviously because the people that need it would be able to buy pads and tampons in a more private way. \n\nSchools should also provide a more comprehensive form of \"sex education\" to the students to increase their understanding that periods are only a natural body function of females anyways. Swiftly punish those who body shame as well. I also believe schools should be able to point to the correct resources for these girls in a private manner, meaning pointing out government benefits to the parents\n",
