The letter only lists the following as its message, \"Do not panic Mr. President, you are currently being watched. Head into the car and turn on the radio to the station 88.7 FM and await further instructions.\" You look around your house for any signs of a break in, but you don't see anything. You scoff at the contents of the letter, believing it is no more than a prank phone call. Suddenly you receive a text, with the same message from an unknown sender, this time mentioning that you will be in great danger if you don't head to your car immediately. Humoring the text, you decide to head to your car and turn on the radio to the station 88.7 FM, as the letter had mentioned.\n\nYou hear static, and you wonder if it was all an elaborate joke. Suddenly, a voice comes on the radio. \"Mr. President, we need you to follow the next instructions exactly as we tell you. You need to go to the following address, and you need to go there now. The address is 545 E. Main St. at Smithsville, it will be an unmarked building, Go there right now.\" \n\nFeeling as if this was less of a prank and more of a serious threat, you start the car, and turn on the GPS to get directions to the address mentioned by the voice on the radio. You arrive at the building, and you are surprised to see that it is an abandoned warehouse. There is no one else in the vicinity, and no other buildings in the distance. The door is unlocked, and you enter it to find yourself in a massive dimly lit room. You are greeted by a man in a suit, who tells you that he is glad that you were able to make it. He never discloses his name to you, preferring to keep his anonymity. He tells you that you are in a safe place, and that you will be able to leave when you are ready.\n",
