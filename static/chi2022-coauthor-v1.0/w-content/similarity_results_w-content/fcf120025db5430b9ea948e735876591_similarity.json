What is the most important thing you have learned in school? How has this knowledge affected your life? How do you think it will help your success in the future?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, students should learn skills that will improve their ability to work in the real world. That is, school should emphasize vocational education.  In addition to this, school should have a secondary emphasis on basic education, such as reading and writing, mathematics, foreign languages, and history. As it stands now, students leave school not only without marketable skills, but many of them are also functionally illiterate and innumerate. They also lack a grasp of their own nation's history and the events that have taken place in the world.\n\nThese are the things schools, *should* be responsible for teaching. In reality, schools end up spending so much time and energy on non-essential subjects, such as liberal arts, multicultural education, and teaching the \"correct\" way to think about political issues, that they seldom teach students how to succeed in work and life. Students also spend so much time thinking about their social life and worrying about their personal safety, rather than actually trying to learn, that they are too distracted and demoralized to learn very much of whatever their teachers arbitrarily decide to emphasize.\n\nI base this on my observations of the young, who I believe are getting a worse education than I did as a member of the previous generation, but also my own experiences. As it turns out, I learned very little in school in the conventional sense. My parents taught me to read and write; friends taught me how to do math;  and I spent copious amounts of time in the library and with our Encyclopedia Britannica, learning about history.\n\nMuch of what I did learn in school, involved dubious socialization, self-defense, and wrong-headed political opinions, all of which were 'learning' that I could have done without. So I'd like to spare other students the same useless and even counter-productive 'education' that I had to endure.\n\nSchools should be safe places that students can go to learn, not places where they're targets of criminality, indoctrinated, and taught to hate and fear others.\n",
