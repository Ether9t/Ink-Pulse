It hasn't been perfect but at least on some level, students have been able to continue interacting with educators and keeping some sort of pace as it pertains to learning. \nI know excessive screen use has its potential downsides, but in today's situation it should not be of concern. There are far more benefits of our screen use in this moment than problems to worry about.  In conclusion, no, I do not think people should be worried about excessive screen use - At all.\n",
