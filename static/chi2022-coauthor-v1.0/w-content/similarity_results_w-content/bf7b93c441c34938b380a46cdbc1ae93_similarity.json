You're right, but we do need our cars everyday to get to work, go shopping, and do other things. But we do not need to risk our lives just to get a thrill. There's no necessity for climbing up a mountain or jumping off a cliff, just as there was no need to fight to the death during the olden days.\n\nYet, thousands or even millions of people are willing to risk their lives just to get a thrill. It's something that we as a society have to stop. There are very safe alternatives such as esports, where you can get the thrill of competition without risking your life. The esports industry is thriving. Last 2019, esports earnings have gone up to $696 million, and it's expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.\n\nSo, for the love of those around you and everyone else that is in your life, please stop risking your life for a thrill. We've lost too much in our society because of Covid. We don't need to lose anymore.\n",
