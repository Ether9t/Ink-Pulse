The bee flies off your shoulder and lands on your hand. You are petrified with fear, but the bee reassures you. \"Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. I'm here to serve you. I'm one of your loyal drones, and I will do anything you command.\"\n\nYou're confused, of course, but something about the bee calms you. \"What's this about?\" you ask. \"Why am I Your Majesty?\" The bee explains that you are the Queen of the Bees, and that you are the one who controls the hive. \"How can that be, I'm human!

You had the mark at birth, and that drew the Queen of the Wasps to your mother's form, and she possessed her, and lied to you, and guarded you your whole life to keep you from us.\"\n\n\"But now, we are here, and we will follow you into battle.\" \"We?\" you ask. \"Yes, we,\" the bee responds.
