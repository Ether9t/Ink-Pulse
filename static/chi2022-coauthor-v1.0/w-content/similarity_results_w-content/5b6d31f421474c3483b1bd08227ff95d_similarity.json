I always have a hard time finding time to read. I also find it hard to focus on the words on the page. Reading in print can be taxing on the eyes, too. Printed books also lead to more paper consumption and waste–and I personally feel it is irresponsible to consume as much paper as we do. Many books are never touched again after being read only one time. What a waste! We can take advantage of technology and use this to reduce paper waste. \n\nFurther, listening to audiobooks can help improve your memory. Some people learn better through auditory means, and by listening to a book, they may be able to hear information more clearly. They may be able to remember things they may have otherwise forgotten. It can be very relaxing to listen to audiobooks, and can be used as a stress reliever. By combining audiobooks with noise-cancelling headphones, you can enjoy listening to a story without any outside distractions. It is like being transported to another world. Either way, audiobooks are gaining popularity and can be a great way to read more.\n",
