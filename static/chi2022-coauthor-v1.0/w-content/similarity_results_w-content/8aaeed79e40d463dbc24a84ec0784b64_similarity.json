There had been a lot of bitterness back then, and jealousy. They were the ones who had gotten the thing you wanted, and it had made them very popular. But still, you needed to know. So you called Jack. He was one of the first to receive the drug. He had always been a little arrogant, but you could tell him anything.\n\n\"Hey Jack, I know we haven't talked in forever, but with all this news about The Drug, I just wanted to check in on you...\" you began.\n\nThe man on the other end started laughing. \"Yeah, right, your just hoping to hear something terrible has happened to me. But I get it buddy, I know it was hard all of those years ago to know you were going to get old, while I would stay 25 forever. Just human nature.\"\n\nYou grit your teeth - he may be a dying jerk, but he was still a jerk. \"No, but really Jack, how are you.\"\n\n\"Great, never been better. We're not supposed to tell people, but I can tell you are dying with curiousity, and given how old you are, I don't think your heart should be under that much strain. These quote, side effects, unquote, are great! It's like suddenly all of my senses are heightened, in a good way. Everything tastes better, everything I touch feels better, things smell great. Its truly amazing. Right as I was getting bored with this body and life, BAM, something happens to make me appreciate it all over again. Seems like it is going to be permanent too.\"\n\nHe kept going, but you hung up. \n",
