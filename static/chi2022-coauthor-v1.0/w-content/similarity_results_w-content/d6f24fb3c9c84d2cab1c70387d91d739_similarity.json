        "sentence": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?\n\nHave you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?\n\nHow do you think technology — like apps, Netflix, social media and texting — affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, technology improves romantic interactions if used properly. It allows us a great way to communicate with people across the world, especially if you share common interests. Communication is a cornerstone of good social relationships, and good communication can prevent us from making mistakes in our dating lives. If you share common interests with a person and communicate with them online, you'll already have an idea of how you deal with them. You'll have an idea of their tone, the things they say, and more. That allows for a lot less mistakes in the relationship from the start, if it goes online. If you talk and get along well, it's likely that you won't run into many problems. \nIt's also great for those who are too shy or nervous to approach the person in question. If you're having a hard time meeting the person of their dreams, dating apps are here to help. You can set certain preferences and talk to people with the same interests, meaning they're almost always a match and conversation is much more likely. Instead of approaching someone and asking if they're interested in dating, you can check their profile for a match and then talk to them online. This will allow you to present yourself properly, wait for a good opportunity and then move forward from there. In a lot of cases, this makes it much easier to snag that special someone with much less work. \nYou can also use technology as a way to get closer with your partner.\n",
