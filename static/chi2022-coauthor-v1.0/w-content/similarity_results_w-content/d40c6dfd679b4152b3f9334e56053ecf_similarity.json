The fact is, society already condone risk-taking by young males by recruiting them for the armed services. So there is less of a moral issue here than one might at first think.\n\nAll sports have an element of risk, and injuries are common. More than a few men have even died as a result of sports injuries. There is a point, however, where the sheer level of risk involved begins to feel too high. Perhaps those who participate in extreme sports may indeed be pushing that point, but the important fact is that young men will court the same level of risk whether people will pay to watch or not. It is their nature. So we who watch extreme sports do not really alter the equation, we just enjoy what they do.\n\nThe fact is, men can choose for themselves whether they take on risk. And spectators can choose for themselves whether to watch it. There may be moral issues here, but none of them align with the differences between extreme sports and other activities.\n\nWhat Do You Think? Let me know @twitter_handle.\n",
