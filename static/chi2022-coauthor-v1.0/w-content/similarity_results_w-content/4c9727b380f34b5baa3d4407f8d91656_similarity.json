        "sentence": "Should Schools Provide Free Pads and Tampons?\n\nHave you ever experienced period shaming, or “period poverty\"? Should schools step in to help? Should schools be required to provide free pads and tampons to students? How are pads and tampons similar to toilet paper, soap, Band-Aids and other products that are already provided in schools? How are they different?\n\n---\n\nBullying, shaming, and otherwise other negative social interactions can not only immediately harm the victims, but also have lasting effects on them that are negative as well. The same is true for period shaming, which can not only make the victim feel awful in regards to a natural body process they have, but also lower their self-esteem and how they view their bodies. If they are shamed for being unable to purchase pads and tampons, the shame can also be extended to other areas of their lives that is affected by poverty and finances, and they as a consequence may feel like they are not worthy of anything. For female students, being period shamed for whatever reasons that may be will affect the quality of education they receive, and also affect their ability to learn.\n\nGiven the negative outcomes of period shaming, schools should take greater initiatives to prevent them as well as ensure they offer safe and comfortable learning environments for their students. To do so, at the minimum, schools should be required to provide free pads and tampons to its students. Schools already provide other products that are necessary for students to learn.

That way, periods can be normalized as natural body processes and female students will feel comfortable in their bodies, being free to study and learn without being shamed for having periods or for using pads and tampons.\n",
