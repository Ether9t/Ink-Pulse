They stared at the tvs, equipped to accept signals outside of the narrow range assigned to the US for the first time in 50 years. The whole world was out there. And this whole time they had been living their lives without the USA. America was the only nation left in isolation. \n\nThe president turned towards his First Advisor \"Johnson what does this all mean? I remember as a child - we all agreed, they all agreed....\"\n\nJohnson was shocked himself, finding it hard to gather the words the President wanted to hear. \"I don't know sir...What did the Russians say?\"\n\nThe President went even more pale. \"Apparently there aren't \"Russians\" anymore. Just the West Asian Conglomerate.\" \n\nThe First Advisor was confused. The Interior Minister of Return spoke up. \"From what we can tell, a couple of years after we all entered isolation several, well, many,  countries were experiencing famine and such, not large enough or in the right climate to produce enough food and goods to support the populace. So they came out first, looking for help. But but about 5 years in even the larger countries came out, after protests and government turnover forced the issue.\"\n\n\"So what does that all mean, where do we stand?\"\n\nThe first advisor spoke up again, \"Well sir...we have no standing. As you can see, the rest of the world has continued to advance. And judging by the communications we received in response to our return greetings, they aren't actually all that interested in dealing with us. Sir, to be honest, they think we are weak and a liability.\"\n\n\"But we're an economic and military powerhouse!\" Shouted the President. \"We just need to show them...\"\n\nThe rest of the council shook their heads. Various voices spoke up \"After 50 years of self restraint, our people don't have the same energy...\" \"They know more than us now...\" \"Our newer generations lack drive...\"\n\nThen the High Minister of Isolation Planning and Maintenance spoke up, in a rather superior tone \"You know, even in the days leading up to the return we had many who said that it was a mistake. I myself campaigned to stay in isolation. Who knows what other diseases and moral contaminants have grown out there in our absence. But no one would listen. But the situation has changed and I have a new plan. We are going to take a page from the Russians and continue to cultivate our ideals here in isolation.\n",

The rest of the world barely noticed. Life goes on.\n",
