        "sentence": "Is It Wrong to Focus on Animal Welfare When Humans Are Suffering?\n\nWould you be surprised to hear that a study found that research subjects were more upset by stories of a dog beaten by a baseball bat than of an adult similarly beaten? Or that other researchers found that if forced to choose, 40 percent of people would save their pet dog over a foreign tourist.\n\nWhy do you think many people are more empathetic toward the suffering of animals than that of people? In your opinion, is it wrong to focus on animal welfare when humans are suffering? Why do you think so?\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, it is wrong to focus on the suffering of animals when humans are suffering. I believe that humans are the paramount species on this planet, and that any attempts to divert our efforts toward improving the welfare of our species is entirely counterproductive. The reason we help animals more, is because we feel that we have the power to actually do something about animal cruelty. \n\nThe truth about humans is harsh: many humans are being beaten with \"baseball bats\" such as oppression, poverty, and injustice every day.  We've just grown used to it, and feel powerless to change it. Animal cruelty is something new and different, and is something we can control, therefore evoking stronger response. \n\nStories about animal abuse are much more visual. Stories about human suffering usually include statistics that have little emotional appeal. Images of abused animals, on the other hand are much more visceral. I can still easily conjure up the picture of a cow, Daisy,  on her knees in a slaughterhouse, her tongue forced down her throat. When I compare that to the outline of a suffering human in my head, all I see is a faceless blob of a media company's portrayal of a generic starving person in Africa. \n\nWe should however, focus more on our own species. We do have the power to affect things, and shouldn't feel powerless to improve lives, and remove pain. We can donate to food pantries, visit nursing homes, volunteer to build houses, and mentor children.  All of these as easy-to-do, and give us power to control the suffering around us.  We can make humans healthier and happier, and happy people in turn, don't hurt other people or animals. \n\n\n",
