You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.\n\nYou are seated at the head of a table in a crowded conference room. A man is speaking to you. He is a film director, and he has a movie he wants to make. He says he wants to make a movie of your next life.\n\n\"Just wait a minute,\" you say, \"I am watching your movie right now.\"\n\n\"That's because must have agreed to make it and you are watching the result,\" he says.\n\n\"I don't remember agreeing to make a movie of my next life,\" you say. \"Of course not,\" replied the man, \" that is not how these things work.\"\n\n\"How do they work?\" you ask.\n\n\"Your brain is erased between lives,\" says the man. \"Therefore, you don't remember making the movie.\"\n\n\"But this is supposed to be my future, not my past,\" you say.\n\n\"It is your future,\" says the man, \"but it is also your past.\"\n\n\"How can that be?,\" you reply.\n\n\"It is a paradox,\" says the man.\n\n\"Paradox? You means its a scam, don't you?\" you reply.\n\n\"No, no,\" says the man, \"it is not a scam. Well, maybe its a scam, I forget.\"\n\n\"You mean you don't know whether it is a scam or not?\" you ask.\n\n\"I mean I don't remember making this movie at all,\" says the man.\n\n\"But you are the director,\" you say.\n\n\"I am the director,\" says the man, \"but I don't remember making this movie.\"\n\n\"Are you an idiot?\" you ask the man.\n\n\"Yes,\" says the man, \"I am an idiot. But I'm also you in your next life.\"\n\n\"That's impossible,\" you say.\n\n\"If it were impossible, could I do this?\" asks the man, and he steps out of the screen and takes a seat next to you.\n\n\"But I'm not dead,\" you say.\n\n\" You, me... we all are,\" says the man. \"Always will be too.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" you say.\n\nAt that, the man walks right up to you and stands chest to chest. Suddenly you are the man, and he is you.\n",
