The scientist told the general that the gravitational forces caused by a fractured moon is ripping the earth apart from the inside. The Americans quickly contact the Russian who are the ones sending up most of the rockets. We have a fleet of old shuttles at our disposal said the General to the leader of the Russian federation. We will combine our resources and start evacuations immediately. Fortunately there was enough time to evacuate 90% of earths population before the planet was destroyed. Humanity settled on a small rocky planet, orbiting Alpha Centuri. \n",
