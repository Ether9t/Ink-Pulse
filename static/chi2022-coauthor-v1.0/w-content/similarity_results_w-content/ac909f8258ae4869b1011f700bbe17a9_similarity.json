We have a clear stance, \"this is wrong\", across races, creeds, religions. \nEven religions who stone their apostate adults usually recognize the purity, weakness, and dependence of children and dogs.  They can do no wrong because they don't know right and wrong, unlike adults who knowingly did wrong, and face the consequences. \n\nPeople probably prefer their pet dog because of the bonds they have formed with it.

They have been bred to be more human-like and friendly. They have been bred to be more loyal and more obedient.  Humans know what to expect from their pets.  They know most animals can't or won't hurt them like other humans can. \n\nHuman interactions are more complex. With animal cruelty, it's easier to see wrongs, and right them. This is perfectly fine, a valiant effort on our behalf to make the world better for someone, human or animal. \n\n\n",
