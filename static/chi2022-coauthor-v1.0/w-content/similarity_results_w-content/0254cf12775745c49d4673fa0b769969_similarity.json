Ideally, athletes should be paid a salary that is comparable to the average salary of a full-time employee, which would be around $50,000. That way, at minimum they can afford tuition, housing, and other expenses without going into debt. All applicable athletes should be paid fair and equal salaries, that way no disparities exist based on performance and prestige. If such disparities exist, than so too can bidding wars exist for the most desired athletes, who would be paid excessively in comparison to less prestigious athletes. Regardless, athletes should still be paid a fair wage for their efforts, and for them to not only continue playing the sport they invest time in, but also further their educational career.\n",
