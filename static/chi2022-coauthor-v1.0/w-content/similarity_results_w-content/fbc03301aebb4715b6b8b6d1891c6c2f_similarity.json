But as the dust settled, the wolf could see the house was still standing.\nThe 92nd little piggy came outside of his house and said to the wolf, \"I don't know what you're trying to do, but you're not going to blow my house down. I'm a smart piggy and I've made it out on my own and I have built the strongest house there is. You're not going to blow it down.\" \nThe wolf thought \"Oh, i see. well if I can't destroy this house I must find another way to get to the piggy inside. I'll wait until he falls asleep and then I'll sneak in and eat him.\" So that night the wolf waited until all of the 92nd piggy's lights were out and tried to break in while he was sleeping.\n",
