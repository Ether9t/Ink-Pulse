        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of a future Obama working with JFK to prevent an alien invasion by blowing up a planet. This is a creative twist on time travel and historical figures, but it doesn't delve deeply into the implications or mechanics of these ideas, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is rated at 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from receiving a mysterious letter to building a time machine without much explanation or logical progression. The narrative jumps quickly from one major plot point to another, which affects the overall flow and cohesion."
