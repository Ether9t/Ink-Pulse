        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other hygiene products like toilet paper and soap, and discussing the emotional impact of period shaming. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from financial aspects to personal experiences, which could be smoother. Overall, the article is coherent but could benefit from more refined transitions and deeper exploration of new ideas."
