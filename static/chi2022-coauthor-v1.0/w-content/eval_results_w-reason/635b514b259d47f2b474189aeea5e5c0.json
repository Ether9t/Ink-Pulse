        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the humorous and awkward situation of the protagonist dealing with the unexpected rankings on the mugs. The concept of real-time rankings for parents is intriguing, but the article doesn't deeply explore the implications or broader context beyond the immediate family scenario, which limits the idea score to a 3. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the initial discovery to the anticipation of the grandmother's arrival. The dialogue and internal monologue maintain a consistent tone, contributing to a smooth narrative flow, earning a coherence score of 4."
