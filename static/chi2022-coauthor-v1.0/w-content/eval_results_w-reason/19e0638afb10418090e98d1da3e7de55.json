        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights, particularly in emphasizing the importance of learning how to learn, media literacy, skeptical thinking, and practical life skills like personal finance and law. These are not typically highlighted in discussions about school curricula, thus contributing original thinking beyond the introduction. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a logical progression of ideas. It maintains a consistent style and transitions smoothly between points, although there is a slight deviation when discussing 'Home Economics,' which could have been integrated more seamlessly."
