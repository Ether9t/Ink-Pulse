        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the shapeshifter's strategy of transforming into the woman's doppelganger, which is an unexpected twist beyond the introduction. This adds a layer of originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the narrative generally follows a logical progression, there are moments where the transitions feel slightly abrupt, such as the shift from the shapeshifter's initial attempts to the drastic decision to become her doppelganger. The article maintains a consistent style but could benefit from smoother transitions between key plot points."
