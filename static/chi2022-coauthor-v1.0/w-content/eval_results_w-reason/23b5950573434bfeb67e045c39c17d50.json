        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing extreme mountain climbing to other sports like football, boxing, and golf in terms of risk. It challenges the notion that extreme sports are uniquely dangerous, which is a common argument but is developed with specific examples and statistics. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond these comparisons. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from defining what constitutes a sport to comparing risks across different sports. Transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed, though it occasionally repeats points, such as the inherent risks in all sports."
