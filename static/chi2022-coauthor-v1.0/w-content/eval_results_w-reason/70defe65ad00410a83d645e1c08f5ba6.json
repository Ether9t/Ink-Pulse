        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that science is important for understanding the world, which is a common perspective. It does offer some development by emphasizing the value of the scientific method in critical thinking and decision-making, but these are not particularly novel insights. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the benefits of science education in a clear manner. However, there are some awkward transitions, such as the abrupt mention of fake news, which slightly disrupts the flow. Thus, it also scores a 3 for coherence."
