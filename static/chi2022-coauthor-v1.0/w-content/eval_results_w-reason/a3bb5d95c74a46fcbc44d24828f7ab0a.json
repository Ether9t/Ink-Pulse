        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of technology in meeting new people and maintaining relationships. It shares a personal anecdote about meeting a spouse through a dating app, which adds a personal touch but doesn't introduce highly original ideas. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured narrative that smoothly transitions from discussing dating apps to other technologies like Netflix and messaging apps, maintaining a consistent tone and logical flow throughout."
