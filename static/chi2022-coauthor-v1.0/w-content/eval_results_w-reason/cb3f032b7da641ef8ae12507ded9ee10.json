        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and a wolf who goes to great lengths to destroy it. This creative expansion beyond the introduction earns a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the story is generally coherent, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the wolf's sudden decision to pursue a PhD and the rapid escalation to a continent-destroying explosion, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
