        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the twist of both characters having powers and the shapeshifter revealing his true form. However, it doesn't delve deeply into these concepts or explore them in a particularly novel way, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden appearance of the robbers and the quick shift to the superhero action, which slightly disrupts the flow. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
