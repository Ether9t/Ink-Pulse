        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to other hygiene products like toilet paper, and the suggestion that schools should provide these items discreetly. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the need for discretion to suggesting female-only meetings. The article maintains a consistent tone, but the structure could be more refined to enhance the flow of ideas."
