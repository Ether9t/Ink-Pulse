        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights and novel angles on how technology affects dating, such as the increased accessibility and the ability to find people with shared interests and values. These points go beyond the introduction's general question about technology's impact. However, the discussion on Netflix and texting, while relevant, doesn't introduce as much originality. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument and logical progression from one point to the next. The article maintains a consistent style and tone, though the section on Netflix could have been integrated more smoothly with the rest of the discussion."
