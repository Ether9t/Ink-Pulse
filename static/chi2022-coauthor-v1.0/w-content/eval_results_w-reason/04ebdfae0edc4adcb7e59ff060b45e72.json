        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, particularly in discussing the stereotype of the bullied kid and the bully. It touches on the realistic portrayal of bullying and its impact on mental health, which is a common theme but is explored with some depth. However, it lacks novel insights or angles that would elevate it to a higher score. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and progression from discussing the stereotype to the author's personal stance on offensive portrayals. There are occasional uneven transitions, such as the shift from discussing bullying to the broader topic of offensive portrayals, which could be smoother."
