        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that humans can focus on both animal welfare and human suffering simultaneously. It also touches on the idea that negative experiences with humans and positive experiences with animals might influence empathy levels. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It maintains a consistent tone and logical flow, with natural transitions between points, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
