        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the necessity of screen time for maintaining social connections and work productivity during the pandemic. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond the introduction. The argument that screen time is better than isolation and that it helps save lives is a logical extension of the introduction but not a new idea. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains a consistent tone and logical flow, effectively addressing potential criticisms and concluding with a strong summary of its main points."
