        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article provides fragmented and shallow ideas about the differences between listening to audiobooks and reading print books. It mentions that listening can be tedious and that it might lack the imaginative engagement of reading, but these points are not developed further. The article also includes vague statements like 'it could be really awesome,' which do not contribute new insights. In terms of coherence, the article lacks a logical structure and has abrupt shifts in tone, such as moving from discussing the tediousness of audiobooks to a non-sequitur about fun following you on a road. The transitions are awkward, and the article feels disjointed overall."
