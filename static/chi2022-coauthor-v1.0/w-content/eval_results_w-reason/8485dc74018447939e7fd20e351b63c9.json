        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the protagonist being declared the King of the bees and tasked with freeing them from a barn. This is a continuation of the introduction's premise but doesn't introduce significantly new or original concepts beyond the initial setup, hence a score of 3 for New Idea. The coherence is well-maintained throughout the article, with a clear progression from the protagonist's initial fear to the resolution of freeing the bees. The transitions are natural, and the narrative is consistent, earning a coherence score of 4."
