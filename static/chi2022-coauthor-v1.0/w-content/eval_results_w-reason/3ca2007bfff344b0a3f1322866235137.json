        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a symbiotic relationship between pigs and a unique type of strawberry, which leads to an evolutionary change in the pigs' diet from herbivorous to omnivorous. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the discovery of strawberries to the pigs' evolutionary change, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
