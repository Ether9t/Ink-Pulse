        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other necessities like toilet paper and Band-Aids, and discussing personal experiences with period shaming. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep exploration beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for New Idea. The coherence is well-maintained with a clear, logical structure and natural progression from personal experience to broader implications, earning a score of 4. The article effectively transitions between points and maintains a consistent style throughout."
