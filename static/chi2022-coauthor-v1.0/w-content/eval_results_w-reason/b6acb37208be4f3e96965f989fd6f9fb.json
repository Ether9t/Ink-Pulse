        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by exploring the unforeseen consequences of immortality, specifically the loss of senses, which is a novel angle beyond the introduction. It delves into the societal and personal implications of this discovery, providing depth to the narrative. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured progression from the initial discovery of the drug to the eventual realization of its side effects. The transitions between the societal impact and personal reflections are mostly smooth, though there are minor instances where the narrative could be more tightly woven. Overall, the article effectively expands on the introduction with original ideas and maintains a logical flow."
