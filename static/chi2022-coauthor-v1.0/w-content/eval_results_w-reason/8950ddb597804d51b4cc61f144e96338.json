        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that extreme sports should require training and certification, which is a common perspective. It suggests implementing training courses and certifications for sports like snowboarding, which is a reasonable but not particularly novel suggestion, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the need for training and the potential dangers of untrained participants. However, it occasionally lacks smooth transitions, such as when it abruptly shifts from discussing snowboarding to generalizing about extreme sports, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
