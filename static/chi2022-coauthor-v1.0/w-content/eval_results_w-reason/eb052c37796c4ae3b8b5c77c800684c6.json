        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a government solution to isolate the 'Lost Generations' on an island, which is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel. The concept of the islanders becoming self-sufficient over time adds some development, but it lacks depth and creativity, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is rated at 2 because the article has several awkward transitions and inconsistencies, such as the unclear distinction between the 'Lost Generations' and the 'affected' immortals, and the abrupt shift from fear to self-sufficiency without detailed explanation. The narrative lacks a smooth flow and has stylistic inconsistencies, such as the sudden mention of 'infected' without prior context."
