        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a house made of depleted uranium and the consequences of such a choice. This is a clear new insight, earning a score of 4 for originality. However, the coherence of the article is somewhat uneven. While the narrative follows a logical sequence of events, there are moments where the transitions feel abrupt, such as the sudden shift from the wolf's plan to set the house on fire to the pig's unconsciousness. This results in a coherence score of 3, as the article is generally coherent but has occasional unevenness."
