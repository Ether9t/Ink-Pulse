        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the emphasis on personal choice and responsibility in pursuing extreme sports. It touches on the importance of safety guidelines and preparedness, which are common considerations in discussions about risky sports. However, it does not introduce particularly novel insights or angles beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from the argument of personal freedom to the importance of safety and responsibility. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
