        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a few ideas beyond the introduction, such as the value of scholarships and the notion that athletes should be grateful for their opportunities. However, these ideas are not deeply developed or particularly novel, resulting in a score of 2 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 2 because the article lacks a smooth flow and contains several awkward transitions. For example, the narrative jumps from discussing the value of scholarships to personal anecdotes about a specific athlete, which disrupts the logical structure. Additionally, the tone shifts abruptly from a general argument to a personal critique of an individual, further affecting coherence."
