        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other hygienic items like toilet paper and soap, and discussing the importance of privacy in their distribution. However, it doesn't introduce significantly new insights or novel angles beyond the introduction. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency, with smooth transitions between points, such as moving from the importance of providing these items to the need for privacy in their distribution."
