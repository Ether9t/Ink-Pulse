        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the ease of meeting people through technology and the variety of ways to express love. However, it lacks deep or novel insights beyond these common observations, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from discussing dating apps to the influence of media like Netflix and the various communication methods enabled by technology. The transitions are natural, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
