        "reason": "The article presents a fragmented and somewhat shallow idea that pads and tampons should be sold in vending machines, which is not a particularly novel concept. The argument that girls should carry money to buy these products and that gauze can be used as an alternative lacks depth and practicality, failing to address the broader issues of period poverty and accessibility. The coherence of the article is also lacking, with abrupt shifts in logic, such as comparing the necessity of pads to band-aids and suggesting gauze as a substitute. The transitions between teaching responsibility, educating about menstrual cycles, and making a profit are awkward and do not form a cohesive argument."
