        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of listening to audiobooks while multitasking and the benefit of correct pronunciation. However, these points are relatively common and lack depth, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing personal preferences to children's use of audiobooks. This results in a coherence score of 3."
