        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a secretive post-presidency role for former presidents, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of presidents being puppets during their term and then being invited to participate in real decision-making is an original angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the mysterious letter to the revelation of the secret role. The transitions between events are smooth, and the narrative is consistent, though there could be more depth in the development of the 'real job' concept. Therefore, it scores a 4 for coherence."
