        "reason": "The article presents a fragmented idea that lacks depth and originality beyond the introduction. The concept of a shapeshifter dating the same woman repeatedly is not expanded upon in a meaningful way. Instead, the article shifts to a story about a woman dating a man with a 'second soul,' which is not clearly connected to the shapeshifter theme. This results in a shallow exploration of the initial premise. Coherence is also lacking, as the narrative jumps from one relationship dynamic to another without smooth transitions or a clear logical progression. The abrupt changes in the boyfriend's character and the woman's decisions feel disjointed, leading to an overall awkward flow."
