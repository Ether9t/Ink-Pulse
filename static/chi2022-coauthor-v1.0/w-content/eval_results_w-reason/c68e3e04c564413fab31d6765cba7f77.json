        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a fragmented expansion of the introduction's premise. The idea that the USA was unaware of the rest of the world not isolating is somewhat novel, but the article does not deeply explore the implications or consequences of this scenario, resulting in a shallow development of ideas. The decision of the USA to return to isolation and the subsequent global reaction is abrupt and lacks depth, contributing to a low idea score. Coherence is also lacking, as the article jumps from the USA's realization to their decision to re-isolate, and then to the world's reaction without smooth transitions or detailed exploration of each step. The narrative feels rushed and disjointed, leading to a coherence score of 2."
