        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the suggestion to focus on the positive aspects of screen time and to use it for learning and skill development. These ideas are not particularly novel but are developed with practical examples like watching documentaries or learning new recipes. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It transitions smoothly from acknowledging the change in screen time habits to suggesting ways to adapt positively, maintaining a consistent tone throughout."
