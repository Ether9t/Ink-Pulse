        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the need to balance screen time with productivity and the opportunity to explore new digital tools. However, it lacks truly novel insights or creative angles beyond the introduction. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing productivity to exploring new technologies. The article could benefit from a more structured progression and deeper exploration of its ideas."
