        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to other essential products like toilet paper and soap, and the argument that schools should provide them to prevent period shaming and support students. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the necessity of pads and tampons to the mention of social media's role in desensitizing young people to periods. Overall, the article is coherent but could benefit from more structured progression and deeper exploration of ideas."
