        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a virus from the 'Lost Generations' as a solution to the immortality side effects, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This earns it a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the virus solution and the shift to the old man's acceptance of his fate, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
