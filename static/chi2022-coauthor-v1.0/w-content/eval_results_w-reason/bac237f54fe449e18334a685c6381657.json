        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that technology acts as a bridge rather than a barrier in dating, and the potential for future technological advancements to enhance intimacy. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The article is generally coherent, with a logical structure and natural progression from discussing current technology to speculating about future possibilities. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the style is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
