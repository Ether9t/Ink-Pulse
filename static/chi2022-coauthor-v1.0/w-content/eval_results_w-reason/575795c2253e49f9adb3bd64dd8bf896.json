        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the benefits of screen time during the pandemic, such as the ability to connect virtually and the freedom to control one's social interactions. However, it lacks deep or creative expansion beyond the introduction, as it primarily reiterates common arguments for embracing digital life. The coherence is generally maintained, with a consistent tone and logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as abrupt shifts from discussing personal freedom to virtual relationships. Overall, the article is coherent but not particularly novel in its insights."
