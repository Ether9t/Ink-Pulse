        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat shallow idea that citizens should keep up with the news but not be critical of it. This is a standard perspective and lacks depth or novel insights, resulting in a score of 2 for new ideas. The coherence score is 3 because the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are some inconsistencies, such as the contradictory advice to avoid being critical while also suggesting choosing unbiased news sources. The transitions are mostly smooth, but the argument lacks depth and clarity in its reasoning."
