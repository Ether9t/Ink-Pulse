        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by exploring the consequences of the drug's side effects, particularly the onset of a vegetative state similar to Alzheimer's. This adds a layer of depth to the initial premise, but the idea of a drug causing long-term side effects is not entirely novel, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The article is well-structured, with a logical progression from the discovery of the side effects to the implications for the 'Lost Generation' and the future of humanity. Transitions are smooth, and the narrative is consistent, warranting a coherence score of 4."
