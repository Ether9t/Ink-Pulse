        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig who builds a house out of depleted uranium and a wolf who is a vegetarian. This is a creative and humorous take, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The dialogue between the pig and the wolf about the dangers of uranium and the wolf's vegetarianism adds depth and originality. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure with smooth transitions from the pig's initial predicament to the resolution of becoming roommates with the wolf. The narrative flows well, with a consistent tone and style throughout, though there are minor areas where the dialogue could be slightly more polished."
