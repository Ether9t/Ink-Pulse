        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it builds on the initial premise of a mysterious letter and turns it into a humorous birthday surprise involving past presidents. This twist is somewhat novel, but not deeply original, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence is strong, with a clear narrative progression from the initial skepticism about the letter to the eventual surprise party. The transitions between scenes are smooth, and the tone remains consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
