        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative about a man's struggle between career and family, which is a common theme. It does not introduce particularly novel ideas beyond the introduction, but it does develop the scenario with some depth, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are moments where the transitions feel abrupt, such as the sudden decision of the man to leave his wife during labor. The narrative is mostly consistent, but the emotional and situational shifts could be smoother."
