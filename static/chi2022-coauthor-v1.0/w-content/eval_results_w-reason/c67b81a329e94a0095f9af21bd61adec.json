        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a few ideas, such as the potential for increased bullying if schools provide free pads and tampons, and the suggestion for government assistance and improved sex education. However, these ideas are not deeply developed or particularly novel, resulting in a score of 2 for new ideas. The coherence score is 3 because the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shift from discussing school budgets to government assistance, which could be smoother."
