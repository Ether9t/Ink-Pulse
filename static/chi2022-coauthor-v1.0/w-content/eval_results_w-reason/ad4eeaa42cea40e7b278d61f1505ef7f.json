        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the introduction with a unique twist: the protagonist is revealed to be of royal bee lineage, and their supposed allergy is a lie. This adds depth and creativity beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a coherent narrative, with logical progression from the revelation of the protagonist's heritage to the plan for vengeance. The transitions between the protagonist's reactions and the bees' explanations are smooth, though the sudden shift to vengeance could be more developed, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
