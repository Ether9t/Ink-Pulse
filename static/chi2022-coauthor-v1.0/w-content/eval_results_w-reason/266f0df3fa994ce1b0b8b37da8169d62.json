        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the personal choice involved in pursuing extreme sports and the potential selfishness when family is involved. It touches on societal norms and historical context, but these insights are not deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from personal choice to societal norms without a clear connection."
