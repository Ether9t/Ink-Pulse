        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that people feel more empowered to address animal cruelty than human suffering due to the perceived control over the situation. It also discusses the emotional impact of visual stories about animals versus statistical stories about humans. However, these ideas are not particularly novel, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the introduction of the problem to the proposed solutions, such as volunteering and donating to human causes. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the argument is logically developed, though it could benefit from more nuanced exploration of the topic."
