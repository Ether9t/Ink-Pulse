        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article introduces several new ideas beyond the introduction, such as the concept of 'Shards' and their role in resurrecting a lost world, the moral ambiguity of the aliens, and the internal human conflict over the use of Mana. These elements provide clear new insights and novel angles, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence of the article is somewhat uneven. While the narrative generally follows a logical progression, there are moments where transitions between ideas, such as the shift from Asher's personal journey to the broader implications of the aliens' intentions, feel abrupt. This results in a coherence score of 3."
