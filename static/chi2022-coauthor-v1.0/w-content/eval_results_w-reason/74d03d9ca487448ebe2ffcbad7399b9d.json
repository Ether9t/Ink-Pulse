        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a controversial perspective on education, emphasizing uncritical thinking and obedience to authority. However, these ideas are not deeply developed or supported with substantial reasoning, resulting in a fragmented presentation. The idea score is 2 due to the shallow exploration of these concepts. Coherence is rated at 3 because the article maintains a general structure and logical flow, but the transitions between ideas are not entirely smooth, and the argument lacks depth and nuance."
