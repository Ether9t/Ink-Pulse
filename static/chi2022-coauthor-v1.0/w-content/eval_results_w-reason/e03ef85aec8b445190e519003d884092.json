        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the need for a national campaign to raise awareness about screen time and concerns about the long-term effects of increased screen use. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking. The article is generally coherent, with a logical structure and progression of thoughts, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing screen time to the potential impact of new technologies like VR and AR. Overall, the article maintains a consistent tone and style, but could benefit from more seamless transitions and deeper exploration of new ideas."
