        "reason": "The article does not introduce any new or original ideas beyond the introduction. It discusses the evolution of social media marketing in a very generic manner, citing statistics from 2010 and 2012, which are outdated and do not provide fresh insights. The content is largely a reiteration of well-known facts about social media marketing, such as its role in brand awareness and customer engagement. For coherence, the article is mostly smooth but has awkward transitions, especially given the abrupt shift from the topic of 'dad rankings' to social media marketing without any logical connection. The article lacks a clear structure and does not maintain a consistent focus, leading to a disjointed reading experience."
