        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard rescue mission narrative with some development, such as the military's strategic approach to Antarctica and the use of a land rover for extraction. However, it lacks deep or creative expansion beyond the introduction, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure with a clear sequence of events, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from Damon being locked up to suddenly being free. This results in a coherence score of 3."
