        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing the process of how mana is collected and used, introducing the concept of 'Mana-Senshi' and the societal response to mana collection. These are standard ideas with some development, but not particularly novel or deep, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the training of warriors to the societal acceptance of mana collection. The conclusion about rogue warriors introduces a new threat, which adds some depth but could be more smoothly integrated."
