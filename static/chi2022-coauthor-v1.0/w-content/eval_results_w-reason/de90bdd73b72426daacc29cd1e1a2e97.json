        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by emphasizing the importance of art in education, which is not a commonly highlighted subject when discussing essential school learnings. It argues that art fosters creativity and self-expression, which are crucial for innovation and personal development. This perspective is a novel angle beyond the typical focus on subjects like math or science. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing various forms of art and their impact on daily life. However, it could be slightly more refined in transitions between points, such as the jump from creativity to the economic potential of art."
