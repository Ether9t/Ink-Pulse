        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing the historical context of mana users and the conditions under which mana can be wielded, which adds depth to the narrative. However, the ideas are fairly standard within the fantasy genre, focusing on lineage and awakening powers, which limits the originality. Thus, it scores a 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is a 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from the history of mana users to Caerus's awakening and its global impact. The transitions are mostly smooth, with a consistent style throughout, though there is a slight abruptness in the shift from Caerus's personal experience to the global awakening."
