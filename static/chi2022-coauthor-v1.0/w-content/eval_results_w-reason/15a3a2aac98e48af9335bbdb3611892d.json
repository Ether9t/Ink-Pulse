        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed to participate in democracy and the need to fact-check information. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from the importance of being informed to the potential pitfalls of misinformation and the role of the internet in accessing information. Transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed throughout."
