        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a fragmented and shallow expansion of the introduction's premise. The idea of Obama being contacted by JFK and then captured by mysterious agents is intriguing but not developed beyond a basic sequence of events. The narrative lacks depth and creativity, resulting in a low idea score. Coherence is also lacking, as the story jumps abruptly from one event to another without smooth transitions or logical progression. The sudden introduction of a cyanide pill and Obama's death feels jarring and out of place, contributing to the low coherence score."
