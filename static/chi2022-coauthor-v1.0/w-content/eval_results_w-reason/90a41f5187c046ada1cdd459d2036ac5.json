        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that scholarships and non-monetary benefits are sufficient compensation for college athletes. It also mentions the provision of tutors, trainers, and other amenities as part of the compensation package. However, it lacks new insights or novel angles beyond the common arguments against paying college athletes, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of ideas. It maintains logical structure and consistency, though it could benefit from deeper exploration of the counterarguments."
