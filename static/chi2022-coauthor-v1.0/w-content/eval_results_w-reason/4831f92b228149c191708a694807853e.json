        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that engaging in extreme sports is selfish due to the infinite value of life, which is a common argument in discussions about risky activities. It does not introduce significantly new or original insights beyond this perspective, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. However, the article is well-structured and maintains a logical progression from the value of life to the conclusion that risking it for sport is selfish. The transitions between points are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed, justifying a coherence score of 4."
