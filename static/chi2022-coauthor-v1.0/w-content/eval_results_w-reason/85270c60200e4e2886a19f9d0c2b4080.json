        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of multitasking with audiobooks and the enjoyment of a narrator's voice, which are common points in discussions about audiobooks. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing personal experiences and benefits of audiobooks in a consistent manner. The transitions between points are smooth, contributing to a well-structured narrative."
