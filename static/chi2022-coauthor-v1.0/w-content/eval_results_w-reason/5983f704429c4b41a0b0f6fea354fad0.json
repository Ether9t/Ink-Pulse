        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the long-term consequences of a drug that grants immortality, particularly focusing on the psychological and societal impacts on the younger generation. This is a clear expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from describing the young people's behavior to the protagonist's plan to become a doctor. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed development of the protagonist's journey."
