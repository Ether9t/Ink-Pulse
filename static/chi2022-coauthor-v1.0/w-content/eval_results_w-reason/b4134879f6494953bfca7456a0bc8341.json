        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel concept of interacting with one's future life through a cinematic experience, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The idea of previous reincarnations influencing the current life adds depth and originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the narrative generally follows a logical progression, there are moments where the transitions between the protagonist's interventions and the reactions of the other reincarnations feel abrupt. The dialogue with the other version of the self introduces an interesting twist but could be integrated more smoothly into the overall narrative."
