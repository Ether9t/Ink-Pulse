        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the concept of reincarnation with a futuristic twist, where past lives are reviewed in a cinema setting and tied to a galactic educational system. This adds a unique angle to the reincarnation theme, meriting a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the narrative generally follows a logical progression from the protagonist's initial shock to the revelation of the educational system, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the futuristic character, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
