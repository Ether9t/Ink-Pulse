        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the use of stereotypes in fiction. It acknowledges the historical context of stereotypes and their evolution over time, which is a common discussion point. However, it does not introduce particularly novel insights beyond the acknowledgment that stereotypes are a literary shorthand and that perceptions of them change over time. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured, with a clear progression from the historical context of stereotypes to their modern-day implications. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
