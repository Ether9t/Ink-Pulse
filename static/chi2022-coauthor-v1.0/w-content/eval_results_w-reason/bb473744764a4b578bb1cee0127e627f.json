        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the necessity of screens for work, school, and socializing during the pandemic. It suggests that increased screen time is beneficial in the current context and that future studies will help understand its impact. However, these ideas are not particularly novel, as they align with common discussions about screen time during the pandemic. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, with a logical structure and progression of ideas. However, there are some repetitive elements and a lack of deeper exploration of the potential negative consequences of screen time, which could have enhanced the coherence and depth of the argument."
