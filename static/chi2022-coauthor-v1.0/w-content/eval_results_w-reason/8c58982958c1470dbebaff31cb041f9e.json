        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding screen time during the pandemic. It discusses the balance between the benefits and drawbacks of screen usage, referencing China's ban on gaming for minors and suggesting a more moderate approach in the U.S. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing China's policy to suggesting federal laws in the U.S. and the role of educators and parents. This results in a coherence score of 3."
