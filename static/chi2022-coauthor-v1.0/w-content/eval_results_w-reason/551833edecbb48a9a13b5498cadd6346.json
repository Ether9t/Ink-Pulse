        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that individuals should have the freedom to choose their own level of risk in sports. It discusses the personal nature of risk assessment and the thrill-seeking aspect of extreme sports, which are common perspectives but are developed with personal examples. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from discussing general sports risks to specific examples like skydiving and mountain climbing. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently maintained, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
