        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that people choose their battles based on personal connections and interests, and that advocating for animals can contribute to a better world for everyone. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep exploration beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with clear transitions between discussing personal connections, the choice of advocacy, and the broader impact of animal welfare efforts."
