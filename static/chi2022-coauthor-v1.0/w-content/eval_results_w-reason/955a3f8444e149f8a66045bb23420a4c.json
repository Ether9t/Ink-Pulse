        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of a person being the 'king of the bees,' which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of bees serving a human and the protagonist's realization of their destiny adds originality. The article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from disbelief to acceptance of the protagonist's role. Transitions are mostly smooth, with the conversation with the bee and the phone call to the mother providing natural progression. However, the abrupt ending with the mother's revelation could have been more developed, preventing a perfect coherence score."
