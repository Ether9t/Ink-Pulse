        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of the United States emerging from isolation with advanced technology and negotiating peace, which is a logical extension of the introduction but lacks significant originality or depth, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article maintains a generally coherent structure, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden agreement of world leaders to the U.S. terms without much elaboration on the negotiation process or the global context."
