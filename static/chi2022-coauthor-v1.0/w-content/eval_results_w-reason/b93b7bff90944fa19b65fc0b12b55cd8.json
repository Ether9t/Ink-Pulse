        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig with a mutation that allows her to live in a house made of depleted uranium. This is a creative and original idea, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The transformation of the wolf into a frog due to the uranium exposure is another unique element that adds depth to the story. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear sequence of events: the wolf's arrival, his interaction with the house, and his eventual transformation. The transitions between these events are smooth, and the narrative style is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
