        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents some standard ideas with development, such as the impact of news on mental health and the bias in media, which are not particularly novel but are relevant to the topic. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from personal mental health to media bias. The article could benefit from a more seamless integration of its points and a deeper exploration of the ideas presented."
