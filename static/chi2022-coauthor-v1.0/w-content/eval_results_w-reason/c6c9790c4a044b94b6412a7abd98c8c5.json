        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other hygiene products provided in schools and emphasizing the importance of student involvement in advocating for these products. However, it lacks novel insights or particularly original angles beyond the introduction. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with clear transitions between points about accessibility, student involvement, and the importance of speaking up. The article is generally well-structured and consistent in style."
