        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a nation developing advanced technology during isolation, which is not particularly novel. However, the twist of using a defense system connected to the Earth's core as a means of ending human conflict adds some originality, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are abrupt transitions, such as the sudden decision to turn off the defense system and the immediate catastrophic consequences, which could have been more smoothly integrated. This results in a coherence score of 3."
