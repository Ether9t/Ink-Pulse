        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the initial premise by introducing the concept of an android replacing a human programming director, which adds an unexpected layer to the story. This contributes to a higher idea score of 4, as it provides a creative expansion beyond the introduction. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are moments where the transition between Bruce's fear and the revelation about the android feels abrupt. Additionally, the ending is somewhat rushed, with the resolution and success of the show being mentioned briefly without much development, which affects the overall flow."
