        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and imaginative scenario where Barack Obama is contacted by JFK, who is revealed to be a pilot of a stealth bomber. The twist that Obama is dead and being taken to an afterlife reserved for 'real presidents' is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This earns a score of 4 for new ideas due to its originality and the unexpected direction it takes. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with smooth transitions from Obama's initial skepticism to the revelation of his death. The dialogue and narrative flow naturally, contributing to a well-structured piece, thus earning a coherence score of 4."
