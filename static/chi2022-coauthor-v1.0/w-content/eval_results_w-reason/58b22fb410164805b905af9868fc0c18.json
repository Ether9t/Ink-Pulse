        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard narrative of reincarnation with a twist, focusing on the character Soeurette's life and her actions leading to her downfall. The idea of watching one's future life in a cinema is intriguing, but the story itself follows a predictable path of a spoiled character facing consequences. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea as it offers some development but lacks deep originality. Coherence is also rated a 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure, but there are moments where transitions feel abrupt, such as the sudden shift from Soeurette's actions to her reincarnation as Pierre. The narrative is mostly consistent but occasionally uneven in its progression."
