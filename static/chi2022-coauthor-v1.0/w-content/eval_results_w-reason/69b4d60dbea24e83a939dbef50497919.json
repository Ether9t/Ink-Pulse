        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by arguing that following the news is not a duty of citizenship and that it can be more harmful than beneficial. This perspective is a novel angle beyond the introduction, which merely questions the responsibility of keeping up with the news. The article also discusses the subjective nature of news and the potential stress it can cause, adding depth to the argument. However, it doesn't delve deeply into alternative ways to stay informed or the potential benefits of selective news consumption, which could have elevated the idea score to a 5. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression from discussing duties in a democratic society to the practical implications of following the news. The transitions are natural, and the argument is consistently developed, though it could benefit from a more detailed exploration of counterarguments or additional examples to achieve a perfect score."
