        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it explores the shapeshifter's plan to manipulate the situation by involving the girlfriend's mother. However, the execution of the plan leading to a tragic outcome is a somewhat predictable twist, lacking deeper exploration or originality, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article has a mostly smooth narrative but includes several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the shapeshifter's plan to the hospital scene, and the sudden introduction of the chaplain and psych wing, which disrupts the flow. This results in a coherence score of 2."
