        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of screen time on health, emphasizing the need for balance and moderation. It reiterates known issues like obesity, eye strain, and sleep disruption, which are well-documented concerns. However, it does not introduce significantly new insights or novel angles beyond these established points, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, logical progression from discussing the negative impacts of screen time to suggesting moderation and balance. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout, justifying a coherence score of 4."
