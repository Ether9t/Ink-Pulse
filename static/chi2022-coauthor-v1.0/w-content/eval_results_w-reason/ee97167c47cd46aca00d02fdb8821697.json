        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of audiobooks during multitasking and their benefits for people with visual impairments or learning disabilities. These points are well-known but are expanded with personal anecdotes and specific examples, like listening while driving or walking. The environmental benefit of audiobooks is a slightly less common angle, adding some originality. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural transitions, moving smoothly from personal experiences to broader benefits and considerations. The stylistic consistency is maintained throughout, contributing to a well-structured piece."
