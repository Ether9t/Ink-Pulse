        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing concerns about screen time to historical worries about written literature. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep insights beyond this comparison. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing historical concerns to the benefits of screen use during the pandemic. The article could benefit from a more structured argument and smoother transitions between points."
