        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of audiobooks for those with learning disabilities or vision impairments, and the convenience of listening when reading is not possible. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from personal preference to the broader benefits of audiobooks, though it could be more stylistically refined."
