        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the interconnectedness of human and animal welfare and the reflection of human values in how we treat animals. These ideas are not particularly novel but are developed with some depth, earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing the benefits of animal welfare for humans and the reflection of societal values. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the argument is consistent throughout."
