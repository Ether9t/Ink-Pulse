        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of treating both animals and humans with respect and the need for empathy towards both. However, it lacks novel insights or a unique perspective beyond the introduction. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains a logical flow from the importance of helping both animals and humans to the conclusion that both deserve empathy and protection. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistent throughout."
