        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents some ideas beyond the introduction, such as the inegalitarian nature of paying athletes and the comparison to non-athlete students, but these ideas are somewhat shallow and not deeply explored, warranting a score of 2 for new ideas. The coherence score is 3 because the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shift from discussing fairness to the dangers of sports, which could be smoother."
