        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of audiobooks for busy individuals and those with visual impairments, and the potential for audiobooks to introduce new genres and authors. However, these points are relatively common and lack deep exploration, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It starts with the benefits of audiobooks, moves to their accessibility, and concludes with the disadvantages, maintaining a logical flow throughout."
