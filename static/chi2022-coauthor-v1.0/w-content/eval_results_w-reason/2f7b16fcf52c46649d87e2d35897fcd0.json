        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding screen time during the pandemic. It acknowledges the inevitability of change and the integration of screens into daily life, which are not particularly novel insights. However, it does touch on the balance between embracing technology and being cautious of its negative effects, which adds some depth. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure that discusses both the benefits and drawbacks of screen use. However, the transitions between points could be smoother, and the article occasionally feels repetitive, such as the repeated emphasis on moderation and awareness."
