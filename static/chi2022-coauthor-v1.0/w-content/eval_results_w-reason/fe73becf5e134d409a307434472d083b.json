        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of alternate universes where US Presidents are 'borrowed' to solve problems, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This concept is intriguing and adds depth to the narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is well-maintained with a logical progression from receiving the mysterious notes to the encounter with JFK and the explanation of the alternate universe mission. The transitions are smooth, and the style is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4. However, the article could have explored the implications of this alternate universe concept more deeply to achieve a higher idea score."
