        "reason": "The article presents a fragmented and shallow idea, lacking depth and originality beyond the introduction. The concept of a bioweapon being released at a celebrity party is not developed with any new insights or creative angles. The narrative is disjointed, with abrupt shifts from a mysterious letter to a conversation with Xi Jinping, and then to a birthday party scenario. The transitions are awkward, and the overall structure feels stitched together, lacking a natural progression or stylistic consistency."
