        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the benefits and drawbacks of audiobooks versus traditional reading. It discusses the convenience of audiobooks for multitasking and the immersive experience provided by narrators, as well as the control and personal engagement offered by reading. However, these points are relatively common and lack novel insights, resulting in an idea score of 3. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured, with a clear comparison between listening and reading, and a logical progression from discussing the benefits of audiobooks to the advantages of reading. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
