        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the traditional 'Three Little Pigs' story with a creative twist involving a uranium fortress and a plot against wolves. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the pigs' plan to its execution, and the narrative is consistent in style and tone, though there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother, such as the abrupt shift from the pigs' plan to the execution phase. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 4."
