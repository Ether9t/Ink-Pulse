        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on reincarnation by exploring the concept of meeting one's past selves in a theater and watching a film of the next life. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article raises intriguing questions about identity, the nature of the soul, and the continuity of life, which adds depth to the topic. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts, from observing the different incarnations to pondering existential questions. The transitions are mostly smooth, though there are a few moments where the flow could be slightly improved, such as the abrupt shift to questioning the nature of the theater. Overall, it maintains a consistent tone and style, justifying a coherence score of 4."
