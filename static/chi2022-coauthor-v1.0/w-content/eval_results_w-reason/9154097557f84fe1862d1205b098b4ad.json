        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing Lana's experiences with Alex and her discovery of his true nature. It provides a standard development of the initial premise, focusing on the emotional journey and resolution, but doesn't introduce significantly novel ideas beyond the setup. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured, with a clear progression from Lana's initial attraction to Alex, through the revelation of his secret, to the resolution of their relationship. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone, earning it a coherence score of 4."
