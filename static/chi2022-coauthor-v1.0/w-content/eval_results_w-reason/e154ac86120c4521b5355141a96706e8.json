        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development by suggesting the use of existing dangerous sports as a benchmark for evaluating new sports. This is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The article is well-structured, with a clear progression from identifying the problem to proposing a solution involving a regulatory agency and risk assessment. Transitions are smooth, and the argument is coherent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
