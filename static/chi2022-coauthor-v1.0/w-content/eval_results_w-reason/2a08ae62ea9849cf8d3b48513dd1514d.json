        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the potential negative impact on education funding and the focus on sports over academics. However, these points are not particularly novel, as they are common arguments in the debate over paying college athletes. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, with a logical progression of ideas, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the bidding war to the fairness for non-athlete students. Overall, the article is coherent but lacks deep or creative expansion beyond the introduction."
