        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights, such as the proposal to cap student athlete salaries at $250,000 and the idea of linking compensation to academic performance, which are not mentioned in the introduction. This contributes to a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shift from discussing the potential for a bidding war to the issue of dual scholarships, which could be smoother."
