        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a nation choosing isolation and facing consequences, which aligns with the introduction's theme. It develops the concept of Prestonia's isolation and its eventual downfall, providing a cautionary tale. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep exploration beyond the introduction, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. The article is well-structured, with a clear narrative progression from Prestonia's decision to isolate, through the period of isolation, to the discovery of its downfall. The transitions are smooth, and the style is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
