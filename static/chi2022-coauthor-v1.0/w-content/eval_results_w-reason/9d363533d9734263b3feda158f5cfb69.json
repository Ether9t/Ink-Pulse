        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing the woman's experiences with the shapeshifter and her eventual decision to stop dating, which is a standard development of the initial premise. The twist at the end with Steve adds a slight new angle, but it is not deeply explored, keeping the idea score at 3. Coherence is generally maintained, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden jump from her running out of the restaurant to not dating for a year, and then to meeting Steve. These transitions could be smoother, which is why the coherence score is also a 3."
