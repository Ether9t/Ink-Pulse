        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the pros and cons of screen time during the pandemic. It discusses both the negative aspects, such as potential impacts on social competence and health, and the positive aspects, like access to information and maintaining social connections. However, these points are relatively common and lack deep exploration or novel insights, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the negative impacts to the benefits without a smooth transition. This results in a coherence score of 3."
