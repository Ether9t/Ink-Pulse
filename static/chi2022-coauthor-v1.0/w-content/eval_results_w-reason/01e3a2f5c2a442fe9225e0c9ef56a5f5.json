        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative social impacts of increased screen time, such as becoming anti-social and losing personal connections. These ideas are not particularly novel but are expanded upon with examples from gaming culture. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from discussing gaming to broader implications for work and school. However, the transitions could be smoother, and the argument could be more tightly structured to enhance clarity and flow."
