        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents some standard ideas with moderate development, such as the importance of intention in defining a sport and the role of history in legitimizing an activity as a sport. However, it lacks depth in exploring these ideas further. The discussion on the characteristics of athletes and the comparison between traditional sports and newer activities like parkour and skateboarding are somewhat insightful but not particularly novel. Coherence is rated at 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the definition of sports to the characteristics of athletes. The structure feels somewhat disjointed, and the argument lacks a clear, logical progression."
