        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of staying informed for financial decision-making and political engagement. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure, with clear transitions between points about business, politics, and personal responsibility. The argument is consistently developed, and the writing style is uniform throughout, contributing to a well-structured piece."
