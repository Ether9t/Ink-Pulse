        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the critique of shallow stereotypical characters and the praise for more nuanced portrayals like Tony Soprano. However, it doesn't offer particularly novel insights beyond these observations, which is why it scores a 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is a 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It transitions smoothly from discussing offensive stereotypes to examples of stereotypes done right, maintaining a consistent tone throughout."
