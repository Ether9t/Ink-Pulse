        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of dating apps to online poker and video games, and the critique of Netflix and texting as time wasters. However, these insights are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, discussing different aspects of technology's impact on dating in a logical sequence. However, the transitions between topics like dating apps, Netflix, and texting could be smoother, and the tone occasionally shifts from analytical to somewhat rant-like, which affects the overall flow. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
