        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing Poc's confession and Sara's reaction, which adds depth to the initial premise. However, the ideas remain fairly standard, focusing on themes of truth and love, without introducing particularly novel concepts, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence is strong, with a clear narrative progression from the initial meeting to the resolution of Poc's secret and the couple's eventual happiness. The transitions between events are smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone, earning a coherence score of 4."
