        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by exploring the unforeseen side effects of the immortality drug, specifically the coma-like state that affects users as they reach an age equivalent to their 70s or 80s. This is a standard idea with some development, as it introduces a new consequence of the drug but does not delve deeply into the implications or explore multiple angles. The coherence of the article is strong, with a well-structured narrative that logically progresses from the discovery of the side effect to the protagonist's reflections on mortality. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
