        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. It explores the consequences of immortality through memory loss and the resulting societal structure, which is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel. The concept of the elderly controlling the world and the immortals being lost without them is an interesting angle, but it doesn't delve deeply into new insights or creative expansions. Coherence-wise, the article is generally coherent with a logical progression from the discovery of side effects to the societal impact. However, it occasionally lacks depth in transitions, such as the shift from the elderly's control to the immortals' aimlessness, which could be more smoothly integrated."
