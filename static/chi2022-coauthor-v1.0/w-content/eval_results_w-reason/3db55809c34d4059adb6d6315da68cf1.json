        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the correlation between dad rankings and criminal offenses, and the societal impact of these rankings. However, it lacks deep exploration or multiple original ideas beyond the introduction. The coherence score is 2 because the article has several awkward transitions, such as the sudden shift from discussing the UN report to the societal collapse and eventual genetic consequences. The narrative jumps from one major event to another without smooth transitions, making it feel somewhat disjointed."
