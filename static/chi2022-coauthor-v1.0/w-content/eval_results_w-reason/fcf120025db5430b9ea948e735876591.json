        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the emphasis on vocational education and basic literacy and numeracy skills. However, it lacks novel insights or creative expansion beyond the introduction. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing educational content to social issues in schools. The article could benefit from a more structured progression and deeper exploration of its main points."
