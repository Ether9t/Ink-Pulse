        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing the concept of using depleted uranium containers as building materials, which is an original and creative expansion beyond the introduction. The idea of the wolf collaborating with the pigs to teach them business acumen and recycling is also a fresh take on the traditional story. These elements contribute to a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the pig's choice of material to the wolf's involvement and the resulting benefits. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the narrative is consistent, earning a coherence score of 4. However, there are minor areas where the flow could be slightly improved, such as providing more context on the wolf's transformation from enemy to ally."
