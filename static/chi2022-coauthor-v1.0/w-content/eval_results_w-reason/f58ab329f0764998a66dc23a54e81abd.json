        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article introduces the concept of short interval time travel as a new power that humans can use to alter the future, which is a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep expansion, thus earning a score of 3 for New Idea. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, discussing the training and use of this power, but it has occasional unevenness, particularly in the transition between the human perspective and the alien perspective. The shift to the aliens' peaceful intentions feels abrupt, affecting the overall flow. Therefore, the coherence score is also a 3."
