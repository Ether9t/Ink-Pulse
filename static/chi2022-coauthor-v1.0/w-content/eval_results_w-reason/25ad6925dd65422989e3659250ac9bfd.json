        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of parallel worlds with two versions of JFK, which is an interesting expansion beyond the introduction. This concept of parallel time zones adds a creative twist, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some moments of confusion, such as the abrupt acceptance of the parallel worlds theory without much exploration or explanation. The transitions between the phone call and the realization of parallel worlds could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
