        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of using mana to create a force field to prevent alien invasions, which is a logical extension of the introduction but not particularly novel. The suggestion of a two-child policy to prevent mana dilution adds some depth, but it is not deeply explored. Thus, the idea score is 3. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the council's actions and the societal response. However, there are some awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the force field to the two-child policy, which affects the flow. Therefore, the coherence score is also 3."
