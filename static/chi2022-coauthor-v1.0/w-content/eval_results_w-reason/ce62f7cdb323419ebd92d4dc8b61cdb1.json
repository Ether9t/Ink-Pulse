        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the necessity of feminine hygiene products and their impact on student participation and self-esteem. However, it lacks novel insights or creative angles beyond the introduction. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression, discussing the importance of accessibility, privacy, and the potential positive effects on students' lives. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed throughout."
