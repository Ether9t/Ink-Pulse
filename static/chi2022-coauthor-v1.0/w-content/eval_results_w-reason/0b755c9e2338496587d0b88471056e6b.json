        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by focusing on empathy and compassion as the most important lessons learned in school, which is a novel angle beyond the typical academic or skill-based learning. The personal story about Brother Thomas Aquinas and the impact of his compassion provides depth and originality to the idea. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured narrative that smoothly transitions from the author's personal experience to the broader lesson learned. The storytelling about Brother Aquinas and the author's reflections are logically connected, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout."
