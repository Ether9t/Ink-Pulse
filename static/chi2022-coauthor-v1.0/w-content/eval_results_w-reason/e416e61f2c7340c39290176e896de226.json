        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development beyond the introduction. It explores the societal impact of the return of magic, such as the creation of a new elite class and the marginalization of non-magic users, which adds depth to the initial premise. However, these ideas are not particularly novel, as they follow common themes in speculative fiction about power dynamics. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. The dialogue between Ann and George smoothly transitions into the consequences of their conversation, and the narrative flows well from their perspective to the high wizard's viewpoint, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
