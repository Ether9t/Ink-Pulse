        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the potential for contract disputes and the advantage larger schools might have in attracting top athletes. These points are not particularly novel but are relevant and add some depth to the discussion. Therefore, it scores a 3 for New Idea. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression of arguments. It maintains a logical flow from discussing the potential power imbalance to the challenges of quantifying athlete compensation, earning it a 4 for Coherence."
