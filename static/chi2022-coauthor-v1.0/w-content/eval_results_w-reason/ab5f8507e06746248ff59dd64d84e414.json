        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the unexpected public reaction to the mug rankings and the company's plans to expand the concept to other demographics. However, it doesn't delve deeply into these ideas or explore them in a particularly novel way, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing the initial campaign, public reaction, and future plans in a clear sequence. There are no major awkward transitions, but the article could benefit from more stylistic refinement to achieve a perfect score."
