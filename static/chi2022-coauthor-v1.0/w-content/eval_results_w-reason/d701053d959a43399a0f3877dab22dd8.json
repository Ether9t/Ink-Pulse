        "reason": "The article presents clear new insights and novel angles on the topic of paying college athletes. It challenges the traditional view by framing student athletes as employees who deserve compensation for the revenue they generate, which is a strong original idea. The article also suggests practical solutions like implementing a salary cap, which adds depth to the argument. However, it could delve deeper into the complexities of these solutions. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression of ideas. It maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, though there are a few moments where the transitions could be smoother, such as when shifting from discussing the exploitation of athletes to the potential solutions."
