        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the suggestion of a flat fee for athletes by division to avoid bidding wars, and the emphasis on ensuring basic needs like food and housing are met for student-athletes. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and progression of thoughts, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the shift from discussing personal experience to broader NCAA policies. Overall, the article is coherent but lacks depth in its exploration of new ideas."
