        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by blending real-life figures like Barack Obama with fictional elements from Twin Peaks, creating an intriguing narrative of Obama being tasked with solving a mystery in a surreal city. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the narrative is generally coherent, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden teleportation to the warehouse and the immediate introduction of Agent Cooper, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
