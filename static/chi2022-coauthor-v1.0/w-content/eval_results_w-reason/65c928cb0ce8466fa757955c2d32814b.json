        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing Felicia Squiggletail the 5th, a pig with advanced scientific and mechanical skills. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The use of depleted uranium and rocket packs adds creativity and originality. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with a clear sequence of events leading to the wolf's defeat. However, there are minor issues, such as the repeated phrase 'the wolf was very angry,' which slightly disrupts the flow."
