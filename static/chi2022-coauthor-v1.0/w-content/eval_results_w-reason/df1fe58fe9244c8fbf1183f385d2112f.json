        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of listening to audiobooks in various situations and the potential cost savings with subscription services like Audible. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points, which is why it scores a 3 for New Idea. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains a consistent tone and logical flow, earning it a score of 4. The transitions between points about convenience, cost, and personal preference are smooth, contributing to its overall coherence."
