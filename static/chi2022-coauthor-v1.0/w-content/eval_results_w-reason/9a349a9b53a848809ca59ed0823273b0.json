        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the importance of independence and responsibility, which are common themes in discussions about education. However, it does develop these ideas with personal anecdotes and examples, such as the joy of buying a car with one's own money, which adds some depth. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the introduction of the concepts to personal experiences and the broader implications of independence and responsibility. Transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
