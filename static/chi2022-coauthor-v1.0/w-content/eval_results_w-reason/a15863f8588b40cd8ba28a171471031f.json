        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and chilling expansion on the introduction's premise by exploring the psychological and societal consequences of the immortality drug. The idea of people becoming emotionally cold and eventually turning to cannibalism is a strong original concept that extends beyond the introduction's setup. However, the coherence score is slightly lower due to the abrupt transition from the daughter's rage to the apocalyptic conclusion. The narrative jumps quickly from a personal conflict to a global catastrophe without a smooth transition, which affects the overall flow."
