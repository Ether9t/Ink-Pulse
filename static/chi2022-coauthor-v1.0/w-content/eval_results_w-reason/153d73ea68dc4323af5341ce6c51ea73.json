        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing the concept of a house made from depleted uranium, which is a creative and original idea. The use of a grenade and the subsequent explosion adds an unexpected and humorous element, further contributing to the originality. The transition to the 93rd pig's solution with lead paint is another inventive angle, showing a progression of ideas. Coherence is maintained well throughout the article, with a logical sequence of events and clear transitions between the actions of the 92nd and 93rd pigs. The style remains consistent, with a playful and humorous tone. However, the abruptness of the wolf's demise and the quick resolution with the 93rd pig's house could have been developed more smoothly, preventing a perfect score."
