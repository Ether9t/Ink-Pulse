        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a movie star seeking happiness beyond fame, which is a common narrative. However, it adds some development by exploring the protagonist's journey to Japan and her integration into a simpler life, which provides a slight novel angle. Thus, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the protagonist's dissatisfaction with fame to finding peace in a new environment. The transitions between life stages and events are smooth, earning it a coherence score of 4."
