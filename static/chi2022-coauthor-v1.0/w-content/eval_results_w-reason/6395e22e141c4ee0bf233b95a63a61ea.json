        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of fame energy and Ben Affleck's expertise in teleportation, which are interesting but not deeply explored. The idea of using fame as an energy source is somewhat novel, but the execution remains within expected narrative tropes. The coherence is strong, with a clear structure and logical progression from the alien abduction to the rescue mission. The transitions between the sections are smooth, and the narrative maintains a consistent style throughout, contributing to a well-structured article."
