        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by challenging the romanticized view of amateurism in college sports and highlighting the economic realities and risks faced by college athletes. It argues that athletes deserve compensation due to the significant revenue they generate and the risks they take, which is a novel angle beyond the introduction. The article is well-structured, with a logical progression from discussing the risks and economic contributions of athletes to the conclusion that they deserve to be paid. However, it could delve deeper into potential solutions or models for compensation, which is why it did not receive a perfect score. The coherence is strong, with a clear and natural flow, though it could benefit from more detailed transitions between points."
