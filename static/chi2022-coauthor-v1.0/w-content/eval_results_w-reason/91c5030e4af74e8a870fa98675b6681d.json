        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the suggestion of a stipend for college athletes and the potential for a bidding war among schools. These ideas are not particularly novel but are developed beyond the introduction. The article also discusses the financial disparities between schools, which adds some depth. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or a deep exploration of new angles, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing stipends to the financial disparities between schools. This results in a coherence score of 3."
