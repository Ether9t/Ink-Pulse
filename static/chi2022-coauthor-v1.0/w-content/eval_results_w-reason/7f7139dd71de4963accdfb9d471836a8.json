        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other essential items provided by schools like toilet paper and Band-Aids. It also touches on the issue of period poverty and the potential for schools to provide these products for home use, which adds some depth. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or novel angles, thus receiving a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency throughout, earning a score of 4."
