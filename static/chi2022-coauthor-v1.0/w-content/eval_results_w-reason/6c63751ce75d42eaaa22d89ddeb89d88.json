        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the impact of dating apps on real-life interactions and the effect of constant connectivity on alone time. These are not particularly novel insights but are developed with personal experiences. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and progression from discussing dating apps to broader technology impacts. However, the transitions between points could be smoother, and the argument could be more cohesively tied together."
