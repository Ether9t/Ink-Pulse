        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that societal standards demand we prioritize human welfare and the suggestion that animal suffering is often a natural occurrence. However, it lacks novel insights or creative expansion beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure that discusses the importance of prioritizing human welfare while acknowledging the need to help animals. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing societal standards to the natural world, which affects the overall flow."
