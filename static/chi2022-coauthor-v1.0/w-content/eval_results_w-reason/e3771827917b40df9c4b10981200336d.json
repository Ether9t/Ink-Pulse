        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the potential for an unfair system where wealthier schools dominate and the impact on the culture of college sports. These points are not particularly novel but are developed beyond the introduction. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that logically progresses from the potential economic impact on smaller schools to the cultural implications for fans. The article maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, with clear transitions between points."
