        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by linking the provision of free pads and tampons in schools to broader issues of gender equality and the dismantling of patriarchal structures, which goes beyond the introduction's basic question of whether schools should provide these products. This novel angle contributes to a higher idea score. The article is well-structured, with a logical progression from discussing the stigma around periods to the potential societal benefits of addressing this issue. However, the call for boys to be inculcated with a sense of shame if they fail to support girls could be seen as a slightly abrupt shift, preventing a perfect coherence score. Overall, the article maintains a clear and natural progression, justifying a coherence score of 4."
