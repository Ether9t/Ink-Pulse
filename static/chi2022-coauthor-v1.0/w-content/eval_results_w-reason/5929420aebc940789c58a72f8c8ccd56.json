        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, as it builds on the concept of a shapeshifter dating the same woman repeatedly. The twist of the man claiming to be her 'perfect match' adds a slight novel angle, but it doesn't deeply expand beyond the introduction's premise. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from the woman's initial encounter with the man to the revelation of his identity. The dialogue and interactions are smooth, contributing to a coherent narrative, earning it a score of 4."
