        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents fragmented or shallow ideas, primarily reiterating common arguments against extreme sports without offering new insights or novel angles. It discusses the irresponsibility of combining competition with danger and the negative influence on youth, but these points are standard and lack depth. The coherence score is 3 because the article is generally coherent, with a logical structure and progression of ideas, but it occasionally lacks smooth transitions and stylistic consistency, such as the abrupt shift from discussing personal beliefs to societal implications."
