        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a fragmented expansion of the introduction's premise. While it introduces the idea of the shapeshifter's persistence and eventual confrontation, it doesn't delve deeply into the psychological or emotional complexities of either character, resulting in a shallow exploration of the concept. The idea score is a 2 because it lacks depth and originality beyond the initial setup. Coherence is rated at 3 as the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, but there are abrupt shifts, particularly towards the end, where the shapeshifter's suicide and the woman's subsequent life are introduced without sufficient buildup or transition, leading to an uneven reading experience."
