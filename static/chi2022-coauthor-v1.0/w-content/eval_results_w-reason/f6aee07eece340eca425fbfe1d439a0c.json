        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a continuation of the initial concept by exploring the consequences of the immortality drug and the subsequent attempt to address dementia. The idea of increasing IQ by 20-25 points and the resulting societal changes is a standard development of the initial premise, but it lacks depth and originality, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. Coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the discovery of side effects to the implementation of a solution and its societal impact. However, the transition from the chemical solution to the AI educational system feels abrupt, and the final paragraph introduces a new concept without sufficient integration, leading to a coherence score of 3."
