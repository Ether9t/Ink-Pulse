        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard argument emphasizing the importance of Math and English, which is a common perspective and lacks new, original thinking, thus earning a score of 2 for New Idea. The article is generally coherent, with a clear structure and logical progression from the importance of basic skills to their application in life, but it lacks depth and transitions could be smoother, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
