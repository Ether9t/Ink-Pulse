        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing period products to other necessities like toilet paper and Band-Aids, and addressing potential obstacles like funding and parental discomfort. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of arguments. It maintains logical flow and consistency, though it could benefit from more nuanced transitions between discussing financial issues and societal discomfort."
