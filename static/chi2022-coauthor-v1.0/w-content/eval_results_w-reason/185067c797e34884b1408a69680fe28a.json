        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that staying informed is a personal choice and that ignorance can sometimes be beneficial. These are not particularly novel but are developed with personal reasoning. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that flows logically from one point to the next, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout. The article effectively uses personal anecdotes to support its points, contributing to its coherence."
