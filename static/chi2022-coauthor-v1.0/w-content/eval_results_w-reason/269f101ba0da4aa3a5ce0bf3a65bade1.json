        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of math and history in practical life and the critique of the education system's focus on non-major-related courses. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, discussing the importance of math, history, and the flaws in the education system. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing math to personal college experiences, which affects the overall flow, leading to a coherence score of 3."
