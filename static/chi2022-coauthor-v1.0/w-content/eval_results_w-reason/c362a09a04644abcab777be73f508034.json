        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of dating apps for single parents and introverted individuals, and the potential negative impact of social media on relationships. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing dating apps to the impact of screen time on relationships. This results in a coherence score of 3."
