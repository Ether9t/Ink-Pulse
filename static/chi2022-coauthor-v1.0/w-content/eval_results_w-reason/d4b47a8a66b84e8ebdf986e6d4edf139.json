        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that athletes should receive a share of the revenue they help generate and the suggestion of alternative compensation methods to avoid bidding wars. However, it lacks deep exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some repetitive statements and a lack of detailed explanation on how a fair compensation system could be implemented, which affects the overall flow and depth of the argument."
