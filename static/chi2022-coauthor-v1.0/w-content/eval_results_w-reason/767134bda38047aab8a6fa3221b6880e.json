        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of using a collective mind as a weapon against alien invaders, which is a logical extension of the introduction. The concept of a global consciousness used for strategic advantage is interesting but not deeply explored beyond the initial setup. The subsequent conflict over repopulation and the resulting war adds a layer of complexity, but it follows a predictable path of human conflict over resources and power. The idea of the last human realizing the futility of their actions is a poignant conclusion but not entirely novel. Coherence-wise, the article maintains a generally logical structure, moving from the initial conflict with aliens to the internal human conflict. However, the transition from fighting aliens to fighting each other is somewhat abrupt, and the narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed exploration of the themes."
