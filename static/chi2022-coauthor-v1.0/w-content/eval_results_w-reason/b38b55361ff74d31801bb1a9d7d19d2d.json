        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by framing extreme sports as a therapeutic outlet for individuals who need intense focus to manage stress, which is a novel angle beyond the introduction's question of selfishness. The personal anecdote about transitioning from football to boxing adds depth to this perspective. However, the article could further explore other motivations or societal impacts to achieve a higher idea score. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression from personal experience to broader conclusions. The transitions are mostly smooth, though there are minor instances where the narrative could be tightened for a more seamless flow."
