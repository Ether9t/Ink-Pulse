        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that reading requires full attention and that listening might lead to missing finer details. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. Therefore, the idea score is 3. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from discussing the benefits of listening to audiobooks to arguing why reading is superior. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed, warranting a coherence score of 4."
