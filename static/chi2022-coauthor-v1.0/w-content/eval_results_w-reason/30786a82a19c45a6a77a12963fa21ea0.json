        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of personal freedom and the need for safety precautions in extreme sports. However, it lacks deep exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing personal freedom to competition without a clear connection. Overall, the article is coherent but could benefit from more structured argumentation and deeper exploration of new ideas."
