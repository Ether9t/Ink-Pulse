        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the responsibility to be informed and the impact of collective awareness, which are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with clear arguments and smooth transitions between points. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas to warrant a higher idea score."
