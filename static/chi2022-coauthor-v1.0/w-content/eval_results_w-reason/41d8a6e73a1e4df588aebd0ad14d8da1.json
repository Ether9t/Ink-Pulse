        "idea_score": 1,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a very basic and somewhat insensitive perspective on the topic of providing free pads and tampons in schools. The ideas are largely obvious and lack depth, focusing on personal anecdotes and misconceptions about menstruation. The argument that pads and tampons are not necessities and can be substituted with socks or toilet paper is not a new or insightful contribution to the discussion. The coherence score is low because the article lacks a logical structure and contains abrupt shifts in tone, such as moving from personal anecdotes to generalizations without clear transitions. The style is inconsistent, with a dismissive tone that undermines the seriousness of the topic."
