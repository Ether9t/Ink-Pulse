        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the impact of financial stress on athletes' performance and the potential for a fair compensation system to avoid bidding wars. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep exploration beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for New Idea. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression of arguments. It effectively counters McDavis's points and maintains a logical flow, earning a score of 4 for Coherence."
