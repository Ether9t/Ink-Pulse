        "reason": "The article presents a limited perspective on the topic, primarily focusing on the role of parents and the idea that menstruation education should not be a school's responsibility. This viewpoint is not particularly novel, as it aligns with traditional views on parental responsibility. The suggestion of a mechanism for handling unexpected first periods is a potential new angle, but it is not fully developed. Coherence-wise, the article maintains a generally consistent argument, but there are abrupt shifts, such as the transition from discussing parental roles to the final statement about education's value, which feels disconnected from the main argument."
