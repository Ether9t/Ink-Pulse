        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing menstrual products to other necessities like toilet paper and Band-Aids, and discussing the impact of period shaming on students' ability to focus on learning. However, it lacks novel insights or creative angles beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for New Idea. The article is generally well-structured, with a clear progression of ideas and logical transitions between points, earning a coherence score of 4. The argument is consistent and maintains a natural flow, though it could benefit from deeper exploration of the topic."
