        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the sensory experience of reading a physical book and the personal connection formed with it, which are common arguments in the reading vs. listening debate. However, it does not introduce particularly novel insights beyond these well-trodden points, hence the idea score of 3. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of thoughts. It maintains a consistent tone and logical flow, discussing the sensory and emotional aspects of reading physical books versus listening to audiobooks, which justifies a coherence score of 4."
