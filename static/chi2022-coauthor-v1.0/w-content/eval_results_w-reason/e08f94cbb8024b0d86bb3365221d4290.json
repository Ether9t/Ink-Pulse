        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of finding one's passion and the role of school in teaching respect and essential skills. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, moving from personal experiences to broader reflections on the role of school. Transitions between topics are smooth, and the article is stylistically consistent."
