        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by introducing the 92nd pig and his unique house made of depleted uranium, which is a creative twist beyond the typical 'Three Little Pigs' story. The interaction with the wolf and the famous brothers adds depth and humor, contributing to the originality. However, the coherence is slightly uneven. While the narrative generally flows, there are moments where transitions feel abrupt, such as the sudden appearance of the three brothers and the wolf's quick departure. Overall, the article is imaginative but could benefit from smoother transitions."
