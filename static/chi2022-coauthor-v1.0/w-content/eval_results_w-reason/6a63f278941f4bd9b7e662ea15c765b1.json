        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of technology on dating. It discusses the loss of physical interaction and the importance of in-person meetings, which are common critiques of dating apps. However, it does suggest a novel idea of incorporating a feature in dating apps that encourages early in-person meetings, which adds some originality. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing biochemistry to virtual reality. Overall, the article is coherent but occasionally uneven in its flow."
