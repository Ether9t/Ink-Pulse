        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous take on the concept of Matt Damon being frequently 'rescued' by humanity, adding a creative twist with an alien fanboy narrative. The idea of an alien being a fan and the humorous conclusion about preferring a barren wasteland over living on the same planet as Ben Affleck are original and entertaining. The coherence is strong, with a clear progression from the alien's initial attempts to get an autograph, to the abduction, and finally to the exploration of the alien's home planet. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone of light-hearted humor throughout."
