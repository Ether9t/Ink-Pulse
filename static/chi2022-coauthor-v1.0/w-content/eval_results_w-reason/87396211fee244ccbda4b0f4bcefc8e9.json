        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of a human becoming the leader of a bee army and the unique twist of a royal bee's sting signifying friendship. However, it doesn't delve deeply into new insights or novel angles beyond the initial premise. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured narrative that progresses logically from the protagonist's initial encounter with the bee to the successful rescue of the bee colony. The transitions are smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone throughout."
