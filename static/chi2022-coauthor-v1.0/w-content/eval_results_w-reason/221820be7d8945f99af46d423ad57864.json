        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the impracticality of strict screen time limits and the importance of individual moderation. It suggests practical solutions like using blue light filters and taking breaks, which are common recommendations. The article does not introduce highly original ideas but does expand on the introduction with some depth. Coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that flows logically from the introduction to the conclusion. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
