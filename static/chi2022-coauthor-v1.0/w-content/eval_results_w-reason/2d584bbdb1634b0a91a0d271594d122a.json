        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the concerns of excessive screen time during the pandemic. It emphasizes the opportunity for family bonding and the addictive nature of screens, which are common arguments in the screen time debate. However, it does not introduce significantly new insights or novel angles beyond these points. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, with a logical structure and progression of ideas. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from personal anecdotes to discussing educational content on TV, which affects the overall flow."
