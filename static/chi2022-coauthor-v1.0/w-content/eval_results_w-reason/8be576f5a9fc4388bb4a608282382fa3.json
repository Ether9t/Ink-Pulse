        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the use of depleted uranium for the pig's house and the involvement of Porky Pig in the plan against the wolf. However, it lacks deep or creative expansion beyond the introduction, as the plot remains relatively straightforward and predictable. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the wolf's realization to the plan with Porky Pig. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed development of the plot."
