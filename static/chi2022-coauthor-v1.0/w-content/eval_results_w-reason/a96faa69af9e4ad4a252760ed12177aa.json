        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by introducing the concept of a pig building a house out of depleted uranium and the subsequent societal and health implications, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This earns it a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the wolf's arrest to the pig's success, and the quick resolution of the health crisis. These transitions could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
