        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a modern, humorous angle with the 92nd pig building a house out of depleted uranium and engaging in a dialogue with the wolf about living life to the fullest. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The narrative then creatively transitions into a story about the pig and wolf exploring human culture, such as eating pizza and drinking beer, and eventually becoming business partners, which is an original and entertaining development. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the pig's initial interaction with the wolf to their business venture. The transitions between scenes are smooth, and the tone remains consistent, though there are minor shifts in focus, such as the sudden leap to the pig becoming a real estate magnate, which slightly affects the overall flow."
