        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that animals are seen as innocent and unable to speak for themselves, which makes people more empathetic towards them. It also touches on the idea of equality among species, which adds some depth. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It maintains a logical flow from discussing empathy towards animals to the importance of focusing on animal welfare, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
