        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of screen time on mental health, such as addiction to distraction and the loss of self-reflection. These are not particularly novel insights but are developed with some depth, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It maintains a logical flow from discussing the physical effects of screen time to the deeper mental and spiritual impacts, with smooth transitions between these points."
