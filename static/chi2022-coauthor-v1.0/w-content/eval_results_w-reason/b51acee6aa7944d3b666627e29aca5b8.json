        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to other hygienic items like Band-Aids and soap, and the emphasis on privacy for students requesting these products. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond the introduction. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with clear transitions between discussing the psychological impact of period shaming, the practical need for free menstrual products, and the importance of privacy. The article is generally well-structured and consistent in style."
