        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of audiobooks for multitasking and their potential to foster interest in literature among young people. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It smoothly transitions from discussing the benefits of audiobooks to acknowledging the unique value of reading, and finally to the potential role of audiobooks in promoting literature."
