        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed to help those in need and understanding government rules. However, it lacks novel insights or creative expansion beyond the introduction. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and natural progression, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing helping people to government news. Overall, the article is coherent but not particularly innovative."
