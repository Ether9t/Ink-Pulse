        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development regarding the overrepresentation of white men in powerful roles in entertainment. It discusses the impact of this stereotype on societal perceptions and the importance of diverse representation. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond the common discourse on diversity in media, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of ideas. It logically transitions from discussing the issue to suggesting the need for change in Hollywood, maintaining a consistent tone throughout."
