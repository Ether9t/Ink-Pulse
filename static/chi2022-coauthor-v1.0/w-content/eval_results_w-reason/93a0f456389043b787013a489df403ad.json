        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the US becoming a neutral power like Switzerland and thriving economically due to its isolation. However, it doesn't delve deeply into new or original insights beyond the introduction. The idea that the US is the only superpower left and its decision to remain neutral are extensions of the introduction but not particularly novel. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency, discussing the US's economic success, its global position, and its decision to remain neutral in a cohesive manner."
