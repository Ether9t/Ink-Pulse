        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that labeling a sport as too dangerous is subjective and varies over time and culture. It discusses historical perspectives on what constitutes a sport, which adds some depth but doesn't introduce highly original ideas. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that flows logically from the introduction of the topic to the conclusion. The article maintains a consistent tone and style, with clear transitions between points, such as moving from historical examples to the subjective nature of risk assessment."
