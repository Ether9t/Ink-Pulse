        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing a modern twist on reincarnation where past lives vote on the future actions of the new life, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This concept of collective decision-making and its consequences is an original angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the voting process to the realization of the consequences and the pact with the devil. These transitions could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
