        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the potential distraction from academics and the risk of creating a professional-like environment in college sports. These points are not particularly novel but are relevant to the discussion. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from one point to another, though there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt mention of student gambling rings without much elaboration. Overall, the article provides a coherent argument but lacks deep or creative expansion beyond the introduction."
