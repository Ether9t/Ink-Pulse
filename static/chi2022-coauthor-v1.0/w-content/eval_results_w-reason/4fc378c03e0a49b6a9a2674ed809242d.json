        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by emphasizing the importance of self-discovery and personal growth over traditional academic learning, which is a novel angle beyond the introduction. It discusses how school experiences, such as sports and dealing with challenges, contribute to learning about oneself, which is not typically highlighted in discussions about school education. This earns it a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression from discussing the role of teachers to personal experiences and lessons learned. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone, justifying a score of 4 for coherence."
