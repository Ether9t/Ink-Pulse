        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that dating apps are a new medium for existing human behaviors, such as misrepresentation, which is not particularly novel but is developed with examples. The notion that misrepresentation is mutual and often forgiven if there's a spark is a slightly fresh angle, but not deeply explored. Thus, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression from the ubiquity of dating apps to the discussion of misrepresentation and its impact on dating. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
