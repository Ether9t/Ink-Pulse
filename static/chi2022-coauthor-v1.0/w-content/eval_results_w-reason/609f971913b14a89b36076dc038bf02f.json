        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of a 'War of the Elders,' where seniors, discarded by a dystopian society, form a resistance against a genetically controlled population. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of the 'susceptibility gene' and the gene-modifying liquids, which could have been integrated more smoothly into the narrative."
