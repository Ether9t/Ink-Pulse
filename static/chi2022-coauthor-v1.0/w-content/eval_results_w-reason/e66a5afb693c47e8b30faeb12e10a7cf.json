        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the pros and cons of technology in dating, the concept of catfishing, and the role of technology in uncovering infidelity. These are not particularly novel but are well-explained. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression from one point to the next, with smooth transitions between discussing the benefits and drawbacks of technology in dating."
