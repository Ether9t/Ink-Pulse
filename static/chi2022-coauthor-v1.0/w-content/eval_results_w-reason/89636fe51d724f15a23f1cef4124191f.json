        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that the pandemic accelerated the shift to digital and that this shift offers benefits like safety and connectivity. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, discussing the adaptation to digital life and its benefits. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing safety to connectivity, which affects the flow. Thus, the coherence score is also a 3."
