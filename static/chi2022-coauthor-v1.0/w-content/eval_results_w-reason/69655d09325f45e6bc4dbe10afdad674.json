        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard argument that prioritizes human welfare over animal welfare, which is a common perspective. It does introduce the idea that focusing on animal welfare might be a way for people to boost their self-esteem, which adds some depth, but this is not extensively developed. Therefore, the idea score is 3. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shift from discussing human capabilities to questioning the motivations of animal welfare advocates. This results in a coherence score of 3."
