        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, focusing on literacy, history, and science as important subjects for students to learn. These are common topics in educational discussions, but the article does provide some development by explaining the benefits of each subject, such as improved communication skills from literacy and a better understanding of the world through science. However, it lacks novel insights or particularly original angles. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from one point to the next. Each paragraph logically follows the previous one, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
