        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by emphasizing the importance of moral and social education over traditional academic skills, which is a novel angle beyond the introduction. It argues that schools play a crucial role in shaping students into good citizens, which is not a commonly highlighted aspect in discussions about education. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with a clear narrative about the author's personal experiences and how school influenced their moral development. However, there are minor areas where the transitions could be smoother, such as the shift from discussing personal experiences to broader societal implications."
