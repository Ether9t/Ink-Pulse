        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the introduction with the concept of Matt Damon having encoded secrets in his DNA and biological defense mechanisms. This adds a creative twist to the narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as Matt suddenly vibrating and escaping without much explanation, and the quick shift from defeating the alien to returning to Earth. These transitions could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
