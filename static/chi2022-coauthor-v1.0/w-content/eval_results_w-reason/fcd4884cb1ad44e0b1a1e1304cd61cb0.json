        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by distinguishing between the experiences of listening to fiction versus nonfiction audiobooks, which is a novel angle beyond the introduction. It argues that reading fiction is a co-creative process with the author, which is not possible with audiobooks due to the narrator's influence. This perspective adds depth to the discussion. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a logical progression of ideas, though there are minor instances where transitions could be smoother, such as the shift from discussing the narrator's influence to personal reading experiences."
