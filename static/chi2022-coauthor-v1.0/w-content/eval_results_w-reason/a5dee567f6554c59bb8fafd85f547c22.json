        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and invites the wolf in for tea. This is a creative and unexpected development beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the story generally flows well, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden revelation of the pig being a 'wolf in sheep's clothing,' which could have been integrated more smoothly into the narrative."
