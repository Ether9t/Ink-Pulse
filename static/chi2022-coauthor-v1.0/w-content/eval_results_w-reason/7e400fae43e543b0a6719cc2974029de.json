        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring the life of the 92nd little pig, who lives in a house made of depleted uranium. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, offering a unique perspective on isolation and despair. The idea of a pig protesting against 'baconism' and the concept of 'bacon lives matter' are original and add depth to the narrative. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are moments where the transitions between the pig's daily activities and his emotional state feel abrupt, leading to occasional unevenness in the narrative flow."
