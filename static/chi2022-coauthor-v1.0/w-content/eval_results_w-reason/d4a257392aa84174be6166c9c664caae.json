        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a nation falling behind due to isolation and the resulting consequences, such as technological and medical backwardness. The introduction of a 'deal with the devil' adds a novel angle, but it is not deeply explored, leading to a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical progression from the consequences of isolation to the drastic decision made by the government. However, the transition to the civil war and the ultimate outcome feels somewhat abrupt and underdeveloped, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
