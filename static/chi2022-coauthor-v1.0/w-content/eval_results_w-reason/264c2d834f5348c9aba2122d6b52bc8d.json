        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the potential for a bidding war and the impact on smaller schools, which are common arguments in this debate. However, it does not introduce any particularly novel insights beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It effectively builds on the argument that paying athletes would harm the broader community and maintains a consistent tone throughout."
