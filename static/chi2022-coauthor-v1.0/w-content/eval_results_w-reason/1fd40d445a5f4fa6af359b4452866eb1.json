        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the benefits of audiobooks, such as multitasking and increased consumption of books, which are common arguments in favor of audiobooks. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, discussing personal experiences and benefits of audiobooks in a clear manner. The transition from discussing multitasking to personal habits is smooth, but the article could benefit from more stylistic refinement to achieve a perfect score."
