        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article introduces a novel twist beyond the introduction by revealing that the protagonist's mother is actually a wasp and that the protagonist is a queen of bees. This adds a layer of intrigue and originality, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a coherent narrative with a logical progression from the protagonist's initial disbelief to the bee's explanation of the situation. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone, justifying a coherence score of 4. However, the article could have been more seamless in its transitions, particularly when the bee reveals the truth about the mother, which slightly disrupts the flow."
