        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the shapeshifter concept by introducing the idea of both parties being shapeshifters, which adds a layer of complexity and humor to the narrative. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning it a high idea score of 4. The coherence is also strong, with a logical progression from the shapeshifter's initial attempts to the final twist where both are revealed to be shapeshifters. The narrative flows well, with only minor transitions that could be smoother, such as the abrupt shift from the shapeshifter's preparation to the date itself. Overall, the article is well-structured and maintains a consistent style, justifying a coherence score of 4."
