        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by exploring the personal journey of the narrator as he attempts to improve his ranking as a dad. This is a standard idea with some development, as it delves into the actions taken by the narrator and the impact on his family, but it doesn't introduce particularly novel concepts beyond the initial premise. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured and maintains a logical flow from the narrator's initial reaction to the changes he makes and the eventual outcome. The transitions between sections are smooth, and the narrative is consistent, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
