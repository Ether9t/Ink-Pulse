        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that screen time will naturally decrease post-pandemic as people return to face-to-face interactions and that technology is often initially demonized before being accepted. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas, maintaining a logical flow from the introduction of the topic to the conclusion. The transitions between points are smooth, contributing to a coherent reading experience."
