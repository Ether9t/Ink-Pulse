        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the use of Skype for maintaining long-distance relationships and Netflix as a segue into physical intimacy. These are common experiences and not particularly novel, but they are well-explained. The mention of social media causing drama adds a slightly different angle, though it's a well-known issue. The coherence is strong, with a clear structure and logical progression from discussing personal experiences with technology in relationships to the potential drawbacks of social media. The transitions are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone throughout."
