        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of a secret society of former presidents, which is intriguing but not entirely novel. The idea of faking one's death to join this society adds a layer of intrigue, but it doesn't significantly expand beyond the introduction's premise. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from Obama being driven to the warehouse to suddenly discussing the society's mission. The narrative flow is mostly logical, but it lacks seamless transitions, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
