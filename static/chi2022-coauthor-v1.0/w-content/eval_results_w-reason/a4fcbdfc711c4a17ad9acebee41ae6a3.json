        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of finding partners with specific interests through technology and the potential for technology to drive couples apart once in a relationship. These are not particularly novel insights but are developed with some depth. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It starts with the benefits of technology in dating, transitions to potential downsides, and concludes with advice on balancing technology use in relationships. The flow is generally smooth, with clear connections between points."
