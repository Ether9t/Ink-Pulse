        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the importance of English and math in education, which are well-known and widely accepted. It suggests early introduction and testing to identify strengths, but these are not particularly novel insights, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The article is generally coherent, with a logical structure that discusses the benefits of strong skills in these subjects and their impact on future success. However, the transitions between ideas could be smoother, and the style is somewhat repetitive, leading to a coherence score of 3."
