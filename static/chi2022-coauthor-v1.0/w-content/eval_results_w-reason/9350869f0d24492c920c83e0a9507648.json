        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and sets a trap for the wolf. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with the wolf's obsession and eventual demise being well-developed. However, there are minor transitions that could be smoother, such as the shift from the wolf's obsession to his final attempt, which slightly affects coherence, resulting in a score of 4."
