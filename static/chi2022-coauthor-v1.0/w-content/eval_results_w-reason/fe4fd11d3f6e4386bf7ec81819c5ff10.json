        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing the fictional country of Larkinson and its unique resource, Larkinsonite, which adds depth beyond the introduction's premise of post-isolation discovery. The concept of a country disappearing during isolation and the subsequent global impact of its resources is an original angle, meriting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure, detailing the timeline from Larkinson's isolation to its mysterious disappearance and the eventual global utilization of its resources. The transitions between these sections are mostly smooth, with a clear progression of events, earning a coherence score of 4. However, the article could benefit from more detailed exploration of the investigation process and the global reaction to enhance depth and flow."
