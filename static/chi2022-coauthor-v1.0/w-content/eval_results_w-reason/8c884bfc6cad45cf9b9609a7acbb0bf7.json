        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the dangers of extreme sports. It discusses the high risk of death and injury, the influence on future generations, economic impacts, and environmental concerns. However, these points are not particularly novel or deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing athlete safety to the impact on future generations. This results in a coherence score of 3."
