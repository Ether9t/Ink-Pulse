        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing extreme sports to other sports with inherent risks like football and boxing. It argues that since many sports already involve significant risks, banning extreme sports would be inconsistent unless all dangerous sports were banned. This is a logical extension of the introduction but doesn't offer particularly novel insights, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured, with a clear progression from discussing the risks in various sports to the conclusion that banning extreme sports would be inconsistent. The transitions are natural, and the argument is logically developed, though not exceptionally refined."
