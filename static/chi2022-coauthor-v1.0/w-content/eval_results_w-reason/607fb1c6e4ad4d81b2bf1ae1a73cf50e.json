        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of invisibility as a latent human ability triggered by fear, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction's premise of mana reawakening. This concept of invisibility as a survival mechanism in response to alien threats adds depth to the narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some awkward transitions, such as the sudden introduction of Mary and the explanation of invisibility, which could have been more smoothly integrated. The narrative maintains a consistent style but occasionally feels uneven in its flow."
