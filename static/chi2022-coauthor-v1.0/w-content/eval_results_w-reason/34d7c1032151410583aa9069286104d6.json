        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel scenario where the US's isolation leads to a global utopia, only for it to be disrupted by internal conflict, which is an original expansion beyond the introduction. The idea of the US's civil war impacting the world despite its isolation is a fresh angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. Coherence is strong, with a logical progression from the US's re-emergence to the civil war and its global consequences. The article maintains a consistent tone and structure, though the transition from the US's internal debate to the civil war could be smoother, resulting in a coherence score of 4."
