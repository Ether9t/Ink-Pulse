        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development regarding the stereotype of African-American 'thug/criminal' characters in media. It discusses the negative impact of these portrayals on societal perceptions and the justice system, which is a well-known issue. However, it does not introduce significantly new insights or novel angles beyond the common critique of this stereotype, thus earning a score of 3 for New Idea. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, logical progression of ideas. It maintains a consistent tone and effectively transitions between points, justifying a score of 4 for Coherence."
