        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that news consumption is unavoidable due to its pervasive presence in various media and social interactions. However, it doesn't offer particularly novel insights beyond this observation. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It smoothly transitions from discussing the ubiquity of news to the personal relevance of news topics, and concludes with a consistent stance on the citizenship question."
