        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the negative impact of stereotypes, such as their potential to cause harm and disharmony in society. It touches on the fear of the unknown as a reason for stereotyping, which is a somewhat developed idea but not particularly novel. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the reasons behind stereotyping and the importance of understanding different cultures. However, the transitions between ideas could be smoother, and the argument could be more cohesively developed, leading to a coherence score of 3."
