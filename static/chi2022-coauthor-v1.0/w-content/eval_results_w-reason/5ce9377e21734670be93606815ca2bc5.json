        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of extreme sports to other regulated activities like seatbelt and helmet use. It suggests banning certain sports based on a cost-benefit analysis, which is a common argument but is developed with examples. However, it lacks deeper exploration of the societal or psychological aspects of extreme sports. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure that moves from the risks and benefits to the role of government regulation. However, the transition to the Tide Pods example feels somewhat abrupt and less connected to the main argument, which affects the overall flow."
