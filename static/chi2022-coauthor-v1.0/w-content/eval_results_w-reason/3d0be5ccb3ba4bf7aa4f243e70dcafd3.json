        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that animals are seen as innocent and loyal, which makes people more empathetic towards them. It also touches on the idea that negative experiences with humans might make people more inclined to care for animals. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It maintains a logical flow from discussing why people might empathize more with animals to the conclusion that animals need our help, with smooth transitions between points."
