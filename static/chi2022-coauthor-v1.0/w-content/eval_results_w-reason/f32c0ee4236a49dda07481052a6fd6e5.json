        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of extreme sports to everyday activities like driving or swimming, which are statistically more dangerous. This provides a perspective that challenges the notion of selfishness in pursuing risky sports. However, the ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural transitions throughout. The argument is consistently developed, and the examples used support the main point effectively, though there is room for more stylistic refinement."
