        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as comparing pads and tampons to other essentials like toilet paper and soap, and discussing the socio-economic factors that might prevent students from being prepared. However, it doesn't introduce any particularly novel insights or angles beyond these points, which is why it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains a logical structure and stylistic consistency throughout, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
