        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by exploring Matt Damon's internal struggle and desire for freedom, which is a fresh take beyond the introduction's premise of an alien abduction. This adds depth to the narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is strong, with a clear progression from Matt's realization of his situation to his decision to embrace his newfound freedom. The transitions are smooth, and the stylistic consistency is maintained throughout, justifying a coherence score of 4."
