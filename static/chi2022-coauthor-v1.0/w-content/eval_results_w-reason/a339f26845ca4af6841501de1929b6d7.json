        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article introduces the idea that the side effect of the immortality drug is a coma-like state, which is a somewhat novel angle, but it lacks depth and development beyond this revelation. The connection to government power and the 'V for Vendetta' reference feels tangential and underdeveloped, contributing to a fragmented presentation of ideas. Coherence is also lacking, as the article jumps from discussing government power to the side effects without a clear, logical transition, making the piece feel disjointed and awkward in its flow."
