        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a fragmented idea that America, after 50 years of isolation, decides to go to war with the world to create its version of utopia. This concept is not deeply explored or developed beyond the introduction, resulting in a shallow expansion of the initial premise. The idea of America being the aggressor to bring about peace is somewhat novel but lacks depth and originality in its execution. Coherence is also lacking, as the article jumps from describing the world's utopia to America's decision to attack without a smooth transition or logical progression. The narrative feels abrupt and disjointed, with minimal cohesion between the sections."
