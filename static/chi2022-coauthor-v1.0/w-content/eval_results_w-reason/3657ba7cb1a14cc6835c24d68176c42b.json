        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the balance of screen time and real-world interactions. It discusses the importance of moderation and provides examples of how individuals like Soeurette and Everly manage their screen time effectively. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. The article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from discussing the potential downsides of excessive screen time to providing personal anecdotes and strategies for achieving balance. The transitions are smooth, and the style is consistent, which justifies a coherence score of 4."
