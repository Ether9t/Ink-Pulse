        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a zombie apocalypse with a twist involving historical figures like JFK and Lee Harvey Oswald, which adds some novelty. However, the concept of using a 'magic stick' to defeat zombies is not particularly original, and the narrative follows a predictable path of fighting zombies and discovering a source of the epidemic. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea. In terms of coherence, the article has several abrupt transitions, such as the sudden appearance of zombies and the quick shift to Kansas, which disrupts the flow. The narrative feels somewhat disjointed, especially with the introduction of the 'Military Industrial Pharmaceuticals' without much context or buildup. Therefore, it scores a 2 for coherence."
