        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the importance of knowledge, discipline, and hard work, which are commonly discussed in educational contexts. It does not introduce particularly novel insights beyond these well-established concepts, hence the idea score of 3. The coherence score is also 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, it occasionally lacks smooth transitions between ideas, such as the abrupt mention of Albert Einstein without a clear lead-in. Overall, the article is coherent but could benefit from more seamless transitions and deeper exploration of new ideas."
