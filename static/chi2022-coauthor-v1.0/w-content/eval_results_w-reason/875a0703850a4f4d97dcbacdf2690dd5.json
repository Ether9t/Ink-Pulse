        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a common critique of African American stereotypes, which is not particularly novel, thus earning a score of 2 for new ideas. It touches on the historical context and the impact of stereotypes but does not delve deeply into new insights or angles. The coherence score is also 2 because the article lacks a clear structure and logical progression. The argument is somewhat repetitive, and there are abrupt shifts in focus, such as the mention of Matthew Turner without context. The article could benefit from more organized development and smoother transitions."
