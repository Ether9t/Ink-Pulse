        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the negative impacts of excessive screen time, such as physical health issues, mental health concerns, and social isolation. These are well-known issues, so the article doesn't offer much new or original thinking beyond the introduction, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the impacts of screen time and suggesting solutions. However, the transition from discussing the pandemic to the new 'pandemic' of screen time is somewhat abrupt, and the mention of record suicides and anxiety feels like a sudden shift in tone. Therefore, the coherence score is also a 3."
