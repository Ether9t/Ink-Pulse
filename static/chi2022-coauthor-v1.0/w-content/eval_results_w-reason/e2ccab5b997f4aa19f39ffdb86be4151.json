        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of using vaporizers to administer medicine, which is a creative solution to the problem of people being afraid of shots. However, the idea is not deeply explored or expanded upon beyond the initial introduction of the concept. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, with a logical progression from receiving the letter to working with the vaping industry. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt introduction of the virus and the solution without much context or detail about the process. Overall, the article maintains a basic level of coherence and presents a moderately developed idea."
