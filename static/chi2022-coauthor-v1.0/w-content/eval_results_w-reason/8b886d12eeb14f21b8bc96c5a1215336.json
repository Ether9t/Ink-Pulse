        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the disadvantages of audiobooks compared to physical books. It discusses issues such as the inconvenience of needing headphones, the fixed pace of listening, the potential dislike of a narrator's voice, and the difficulty of sharing audiobooks. These points are fairly common critiques and do not offer particularly novel insights, hence the idea score of 3. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, logical progression of points. Each paragraph addresses a specific disadvantage, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout, which justifies a coherence score of 4."
