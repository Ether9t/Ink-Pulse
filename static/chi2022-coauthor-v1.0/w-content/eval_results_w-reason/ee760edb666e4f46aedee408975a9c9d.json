        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. The twist that the mug was not Caleb's but rather a thrift store find adds a humorous and unexpected angle, which elevates the idea score to a 3. However, it doesn't delve deeply into new insights or multiple original ideas. The coherence score is a 4 because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. The transition from Caleb's initial panic to the realization about the mug's origin is smooth, and the dialogue between Caleb and his son is consistent and contributes to the narrative flow."
