        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that pads and tampons are different from other hygiene products because they are not universally needed by all students. It also suggests selling these products at a lower price, which is a practical solution but not particularly novel. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. However, the argument about boys demanding their own products if pads and tampons are provided is somewhat speculative and could disrupt the flow. Overall, the article is coherent but occasionally uneven in its reasoning."
