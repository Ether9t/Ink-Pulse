        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing depleted uranium as a building material, which is an unexpected and creative angle. The interaction between the wolf and the pigs, particularly the wolf's concern for safety and the use of a radiation tool, adds originality to the narrative. The idea of the wolf and pig deciding to have lunch together after the house is blown up is another unique element. For coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression of events. The dialogue between the characters is consistent and contributes to the story's flow. However, the transition from the wolf's initial hesitation to the decision to use dynamite could be smoother, which slightly affects the coherence score."
