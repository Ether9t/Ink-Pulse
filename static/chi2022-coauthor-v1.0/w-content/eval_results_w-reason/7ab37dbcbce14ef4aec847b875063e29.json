        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the negative impact of technology on dating, such as promoting superficiality and dishonesty, which are commonly discussed in this context. However, it does develop these ideas with some depth, discussing aspects like 'ghosting' and the pursuit of perfection, which adds some value beyond the introduction. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from one point to the next, maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout. The transitions between points are smooth, earning it a coherence score of 4."
