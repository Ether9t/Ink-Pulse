        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing the concept of houses made from depleted uranium, which is a creative and original idea. This adds a new dimension to the story, earning it a high score for new ideas. The dialogue between the pig and the wolf further develops this concept, showing the pig's confidence and the wolf's frustration, which adds depth to the narrative. For coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, with clear transitions between the pig's dialogue and the wolf's reactions. The style is consistent, and the story flows well from the introduction of the depleted uranium to the wolf's eventual retreat. However, the article could have been slightly more refined in its transitions, which is why it did not receive a perfect score."
