        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and creative expansion beyond the introduction by introducing the concept of 'Operation No Wolf' and the subsequent peaceful life of the 93rd little pig. The idea of a pig becoming a renowned oncologist and developing a cancer cure is an original and imaginative twist. The article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the explosion to the pig's achievements, though the transition from the explosion to the peaceful life could be smoother. Overall, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression, earning it a coherence score of 4."
