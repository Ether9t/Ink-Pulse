        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a humorous twist on the initial premise by revealing that the aliens mistakenly kidnapped Mark Wahlberg instead of Matt Damon. This adds a layer of comedy and surprise, which is a standard but entertaining development beyond the introduction, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. However, the article does not delve deeply into the implications or further explore the scenario, which limits its originality. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following the sequence of events from the kidnapping to the resolution. However, the transition from the President's reaction to the discovery of the mistaken identity is somewhat abrupt, and the conclusion about Mark Wahlberg's credibility feels slightly disconnected from the rest of the narrative, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
