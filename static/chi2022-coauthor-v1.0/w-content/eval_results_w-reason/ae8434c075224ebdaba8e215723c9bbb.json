        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative impact of stereotypical characters, which is why it scores a 3 for New Idea. It discusses the harm of stereotypes and the importance of supporting content that avoids them, but these are common arguments in discussions about media representation. For Coherence, the article scores a 4 as it maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. The transitions between points are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed, though it lacks a deeper exploration of the topic."
