        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 2,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea about the misuse of Japanese-American internment stories in media, which is a relevant but not particularly novel angle. It touches on the impact of these portrayals on public perception and the need for diverse perspectives, which are important points but not deeply explored. Thus, it scores a 3 for idea. In terms of coherence, the article lacks smooth transitions and has some abrupt shifts, particularly when moving from discussing Japanese-American portrayals to a broader discussion on stereotypes. The structure feels somewhat fragmented, leading to a coherence score of 2."
