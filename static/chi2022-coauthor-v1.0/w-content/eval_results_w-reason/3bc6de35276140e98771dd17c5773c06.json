        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by challenging the notion that caring for animal welfare detracts from human welfare, suggesting instead that empathy is not a zero-sum game. It introduces the idea that emotional coping mechanisms influence empathy and that activism should focus on supporting diverse causes rather than dividing them. These are novel angles beyond the introduction. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that progresses logically from discussing human emotional responses to advocating for a more inclusive approach to empathy and activism. Transitions are mostly smooth, maintaining a consistent tone throughout."
