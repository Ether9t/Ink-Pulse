        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of a human being chosen as a leader of bees due to their love of honey, which is an unexpected and creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of the Almighty King of the Bees and the protagonist's interaction with the bee Michael and the queen bee adds depth to the narrative, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the protagonist's initial shock to their eventual decision to send the bees away.
