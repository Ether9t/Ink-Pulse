        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of staying informed to make rational choices and the impact of world events on local issues. However, it doesn't offer particularly novel insights beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression. It effectively uses examples like the presidential election and the situation in Afghanistan to support its arguments, and transitions between points are generally smooth."
