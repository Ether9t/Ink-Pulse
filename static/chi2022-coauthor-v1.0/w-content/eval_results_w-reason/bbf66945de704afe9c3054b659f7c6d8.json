        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to other school-provided items like toilet paper and Band-Aids, and the suggestion of changing perceptions to normalize their availability. However, it lacks deep or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing stigma to funding without a clear connection. The article could benefit from a more structured argument and smoother transitions between ideas."
