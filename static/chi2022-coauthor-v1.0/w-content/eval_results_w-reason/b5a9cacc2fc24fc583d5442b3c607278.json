        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a former president being warned of danger and taking refuge in a safe house. It develops this idea with some detail, such as the involvement of Ben Rhodes and the eventual resolution of the threat, but it doesn't introduce particularly novel angles or insights beyond the initial premise. Therefore, it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, following Obama's actions from receiving the warning to returning home. However, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from receiving the text to the news reports about politicians being targeted, which affects the overall flow. Thus, it also scores a 3 for coherence."
