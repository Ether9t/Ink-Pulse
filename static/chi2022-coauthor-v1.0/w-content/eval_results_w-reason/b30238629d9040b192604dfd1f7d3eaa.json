        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the suggestion for schools to assess their budgets and consider fundraising or community donations to provide free pads and tampons. It also introduces the idea of allowing students to stay home during menstruation, which is a somewhat novel angle. However, these ideas are not deeply explored or particularly original. The coherence of the article is generally maintained, with a logical structure and some natural progression. However, the transition to the idea of allowing students to stay home is somewhat abrupt, and the article could benefit from more stylistic consistency and smoother transitions."
