        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article provides a standard exploration of the topic of stereotypical characters, particularly focusing on Asian stereotypes in media. It offers some development beyond the introduction by discussing personal experiences and recent positive changes in media representation, which adds depth to the discussion. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights or angles, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured, with a logical flow from personal experiences to broader societal changes, and it maintains a consistent tone throughout."
