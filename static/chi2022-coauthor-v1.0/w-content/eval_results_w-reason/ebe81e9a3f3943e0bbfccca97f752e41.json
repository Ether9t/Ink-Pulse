        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of audiobooks to experiencing a painting without seeing it in person, and the notion of audiobooks as an alternative rather than a primary choice. These ideas are not particularly novel but are developed with some depth. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural transitions throughout. The author clearly distinguishes between the experiences of listening and reading, and provides practical suggestions for when to use audiobooks, contributing to a well-structured argument."
