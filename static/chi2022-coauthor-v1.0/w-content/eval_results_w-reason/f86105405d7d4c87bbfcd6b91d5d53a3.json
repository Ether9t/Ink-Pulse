        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison between traditional sports and extreme sports, and the argument that risks in extreme sports will decrease over time with better safety measures. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep exploration beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression. It logically transitions from discussing the inherent risks in all sports to addressing the societal costs and potential for reduced danger over time, maintaining a consistent tone throughout."
