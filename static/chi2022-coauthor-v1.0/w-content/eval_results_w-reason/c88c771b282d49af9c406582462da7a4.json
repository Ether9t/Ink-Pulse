        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed to make civic decisions and the accessibility of news through various media. However, it lacks novel insights or creative angles, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts, maintaining logical flow and consistency throughout, despite not being particularly innovative."
