        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that social interaction is crucial for students, which is a common perspective. It does not introduce particularly novel insights beyond emphasizing the importance of social skills and the role of school in providing a social environment, hence the idea score of 3. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing the role of schools in social development and contrasting it with homeschooling. However, the transition from discussing social skills to criticizing homeschooling is somewhat abrupt, leading to a coherence score of 3."
