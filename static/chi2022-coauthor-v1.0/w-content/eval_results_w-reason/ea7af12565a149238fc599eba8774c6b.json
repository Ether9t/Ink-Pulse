        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a former president being called back into action, but with a twist that involves writing a book or going on a talk-show circuit. This is a somewhat novel angle, but not deeply original, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of a talent agency and the mention of James Franklin Kennedy without much context or development, which affects the flow. Therefore, the coherence score is also a 3."
