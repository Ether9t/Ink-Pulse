        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development about how technology affects dating, such as the increased chances of meeting someone through dating apps and the influence of media on relationship perspectives. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The article is generally well-structured, with a clear progression from discussing dating apps to personal anecdotes and research findings, which supports a coherence score of 4. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the narrative is consistent, though it could benefit from deeper exploration of the ideas presented."
