        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the life of Anna and her relationship with David. The concept of reincarnations watching their next life is not deeply explored beyond the introduction, but the narrative of Anna and David's life offers a unique angle with the 'Big Owl and Small Owl' solution to David's fear of the dark. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas, thus scoring a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, following Anna's life story with a logical progression. However, there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt introduction of David's fear and the quick resolution, which affects the overall flow, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
