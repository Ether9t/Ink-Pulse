        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the compensation of college athletes. It argues that athletes should be paid like other workers, highlighting their role in generating revenue and serving as the face of their schools. The article also suggests solutions like raising ticket prices and paying athletes a standard wage. However, these ideas are not particularly novel, as they are common arguments in the debate over paying college athletes. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from discussing the role of athletes to the financial aspects and concludes with a comparison to professional athletes, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
