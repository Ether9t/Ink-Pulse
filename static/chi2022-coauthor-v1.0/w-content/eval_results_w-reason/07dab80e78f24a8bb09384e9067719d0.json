        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of screen time in health, safety, work, and education. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated and relevant to the topic. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure, with clear transitions between the different benefits of screen time. The progression from health to safety, work, and education is natural and well-organized, contributing to a well-structured argument."
