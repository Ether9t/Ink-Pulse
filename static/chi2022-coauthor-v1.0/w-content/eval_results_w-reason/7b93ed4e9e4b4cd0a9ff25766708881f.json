        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that critical thinking is essential for students, which is a common perspective in educational discussions. It does develop this idea by linking it to democratic participation and personal independence, but these are not particularly novel insights. Therefore, it scores a 3 for idea development. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured, with a logical progression from the importance of basic skills to the necessity of critical thinking. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
