        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of a human gaining control over a bee hive through a sting, which is an original and creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of feeling the hive's thoughts and the urgency to protect them adds depth to the narrative, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure with a clear progression from the initial sting to the resolution of finding a safe place for the bees. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the narrative is consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
