        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on reincarnation by exploring the concept of watching one's future life unfold in a cinema with past reincarnations. This is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are moments of unevenness, such as the abrupt transition from contemplating control over one's fate to the sudden reappearance of the screen outside the theater. These shifts could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
