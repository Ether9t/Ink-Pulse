        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of a dystopian future dominated by corporations, which is a common theme in speculative fiction. However, it does introduce some development beyond the introduction, such as the U.S. using its isolation to build a powerful military and devising a strategy to disrupt the corporations' data gathering. This adds some depth to the narrative, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, moving from the shock of the U.S. reemerging to the plan to dismantle the corporations. However, the transitions between the U.S.'s isolation, the rise of corporations, and the eventual revolt are somewhat abrupt and could be smoother, leading to a coherence score of 3."
