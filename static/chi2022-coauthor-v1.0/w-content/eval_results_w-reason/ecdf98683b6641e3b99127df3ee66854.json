        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by introducing the concept of a pig building a house out of depleted uranium, which is a creative and unexpected twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story. This contributes a clear new insight, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the pig's personal success to the plight of his siblings. Additionally, the article introduces the concept of radiation without fully integrating it into the narrative, which slightly disrupts the flow."
