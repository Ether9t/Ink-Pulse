        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous take on the recurring theme of rescuing Matt Damon, introducing creative elements like the Red Skulls and the concept of a clone army. This originality earns it a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is a 3 due to some uneven transitions and a lack of detailed explanation about the rescue mission and the clone twist. The narrative jumps quickly from the rescue to the revelation of the clone, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
