        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed about global events and the potential for informed individuals to take action. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that progresses logically from the challenges of information overload to the benefits of being informed. The article maintains a consistent style and tone, with clear transitions between points, contributing to a smooth reading experience."
