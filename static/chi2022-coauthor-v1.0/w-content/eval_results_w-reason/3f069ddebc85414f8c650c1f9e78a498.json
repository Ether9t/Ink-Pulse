        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing the concept of the 92nd pig building a house out of depleted uranium, which is a creative and original idea. The narrative further develops with the pig using a trapdoor to defeat the wolf, and the subsequent transformation of the pigs into 'Super Pigs' who contribute to society in various ways. This adds depth and originality beyond the introduction. The coherence is strong, with a clear progression from the pig's preparation to the wolf's defeat and the pigs' societal roles. However, the transition from the individual story of the 92nd pig to the collective actions of the other pigs could be smoother, which is why it scores a 4 instead of a 5."
