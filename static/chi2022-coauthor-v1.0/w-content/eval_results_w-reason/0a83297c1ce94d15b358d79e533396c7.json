        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the impact of screen time on childhood obesity and addiction, which are well-known concerns. However, it does offer a balanced perspective on the necessity of screens during the pandemic, which adds some depth. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that transitions smoothly from concerns about screen time to the benefits during the pandemic. The article maintains a logical flow and stylistic consistency throughout, though it could benefit from more novel insights to score higher in the idea category."
