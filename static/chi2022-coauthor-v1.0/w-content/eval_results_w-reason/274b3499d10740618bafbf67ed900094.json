        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the benefits of dating apps for single parents and the analogy of eggs to illustrate the potential misuse of technology. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article generally maintains a logical structure, discussing both the positive and negative aspects of technology in dating. However, there are some awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing dating apps to the analogy about eggs, which affects the overall flow, resulting in a coherence score of 3."
