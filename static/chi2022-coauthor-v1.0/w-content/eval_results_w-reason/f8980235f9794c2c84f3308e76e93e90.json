        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents several new insights beyond the introduction, such as the importance of teaching life skills like tax filing, voting, and relationship management, which are not typically emphasized in traditional curricula. It also discusses the need for restructuring college admissions to focus on teamwork and real-world skills rather than standardized tests. These ideas contribute to a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are occasional abrupt transitions, such as the shift from discussing life skills to addressing school shootings, which could be more smoothly integrated."
