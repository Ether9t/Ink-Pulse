        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by suggesting that JFK faked his death and has been living in hiding, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. The concept of a secret server with hidden government files adds another layer of originality. However, the article's coherence is somewhat uneven. While the narrative is generally clear, the transition from Obama's disbelief to his eventual decision not to release the files feels rushed. Additionally, the sudden release of the files by JFK and the ensuing chaos could have been developed more smoothly to enhance the logical flow."
