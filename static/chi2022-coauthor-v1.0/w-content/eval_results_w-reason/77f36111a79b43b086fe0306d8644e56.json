        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the convenience of audiobooks and the ability to multitask while listening, which are common arguments in favor of audiobooks. However, it does not delve deeply into novel insights or explore unique perspectives beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from discussing the convenience of audiobooks to personal preferences and daily routines, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
