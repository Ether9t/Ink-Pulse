        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea of the United States using a bio weapon to leverage advanced technology and resources from the rest of the world. This concept is somewhat developed but lacks depth or originality, earning it a score of 3 for new ideas. The article maintains a generally coherent structure, with a logical progression from the development of the bio weapon to the negotiation and exchange of resources. However, the transitions between sections could be smoother, and the narrative feels somewhat rushed, leading to a coherence score of 3."
