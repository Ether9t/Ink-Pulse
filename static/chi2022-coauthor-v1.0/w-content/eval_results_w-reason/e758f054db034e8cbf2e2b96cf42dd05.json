        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents some standard ideas with development beyond the introduction, such as the concept of 'Watchers' and the biological changes in humans leading to a population boom. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, warranting a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally coherent structure, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the Watchers' role to the biological changes in humans. The narrative about the Watchers' memory loss and hallucinations is somewhat disjointed, affecting the overall flow. Therefore, the coherence score is also a 3."
