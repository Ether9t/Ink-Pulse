        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the argument that student athletes generate significant revenue for universities and the suggestion of holding money in a bank account until graduation. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shift from discussing the unfairness of not paying athletes to the suggestion of financial management solutions. Overall, the article is coherent but occasionally uneven in its flow."
