        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing David's attempts to perfect his approach and the eventual revelation of his true nature. However, the idea of a shapeshifter trying repeatedly to win someone's heart is not deeply explored beyond the initial premise, resulting in a standard development of the concept. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden confrontation and the quick resolution leading to marriage, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
