        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by emphasizing the importance of personal finance education in schools, which is not commonly highlighted in discussions about essential school subjects. This focus on financial literacy as a means to foster independence and responsibility is a novel angle, earning it a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 4, as the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from discussing the lack of financial education to its potential benefits. The personal anecdote about the author's experience as a line cook adds depth and relevance, although there are minor transitions that could be smoother."
