        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard argument that extreme sports like mountain climbing are too dangerous to be considered sports, which aligns with the introduction's theme. It offers some development by comparing extreme mountain climbing to other activities like riding motorcycles without helmets and using handguns without licenses. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights into the motivations or societal impacts of such sports, which limits the idea score to 3. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, but there are some abrupt transitions, such as the shift from defining sport to discussing the dangers of mountain climbing, which affects the flow and results in a coherence score of 3."
