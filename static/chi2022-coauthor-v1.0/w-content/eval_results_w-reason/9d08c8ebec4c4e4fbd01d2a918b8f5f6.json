        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the negative impact of stereotypical portrayals of Black and Hispanic characters in media. It discusses the perpetuation of stereotypes and suggests that Hollywood should focus on more realistic and diverse narratives. However, these ideas are not particularly novel, as they have been discussed widely in media criticism. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from discussing specific stereotypes to broader implications and potential solutions, maintaining stylistic consistency throughout."
