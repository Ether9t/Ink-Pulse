        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article provides a standard critique of stereotypical characters, specifically focusing on Cho Chang from the Harry Potter series. It discusses the issues of racial stereotyping and the lack of depth in such characters, which are common points in discussions about representation. Therefore, the idea score is 3, as it offers some development but not particularly novel insights. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured, with a clear progression from identifying the problem to discussing its implications and concluding with a call to action for audiences. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed throughout."
