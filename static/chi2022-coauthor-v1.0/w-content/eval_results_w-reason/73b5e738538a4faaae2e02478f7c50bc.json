        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of a human being recognized as 'majesty' by bees, which is an interesting twist on the typical human-bee interaction. The concept of bees having a longstanding relationship with the protagonist's family and seeking help against murder hornets adds depth and originality, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is strong, with a clear narrative progression from the bee's introduction to the protagonist's decision to help, and the resolution of the conflict. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the story maintains a consistent tone, justifying a coherence score of 4."
