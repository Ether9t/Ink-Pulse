        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium, which is a creative and original idea. The escalation of the wolf's attempts to destroy the house, culminating in the use of nuclear weapons and divine intervention, adds further originality and humor, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are abrupt shifts, such as the sudden divine intervention and the introduction of pigs thriving in a radioactive environment, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
