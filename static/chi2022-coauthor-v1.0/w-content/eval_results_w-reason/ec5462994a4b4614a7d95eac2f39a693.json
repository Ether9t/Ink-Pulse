        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing the concept of a house made of depleted uranium, which is a creative and original idea. This adds a new dimension to the story, exploring themes of safety, environmental concerns, and regulatory intervention, which are not typically associated with the original tale. Therefore, it scores a 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence of the article is somewhat uneven. While the narrative follows a logical sequence, the transition from the wolf's dialogue to the EPA's intervention and the pig's demise is abrupt and lacks smoothness. The tone shifts from a whimsical story to a more serious commentary on environmental hazards, which could be jarring for some readers. Thus, it scores a 3 for coherence."
