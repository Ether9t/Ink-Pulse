        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the impact of dating apps on self-esteem and the dual nature of technology in relationships. These are not particularly novel insights but are well-articulated. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression. It transitions smoothly from discussing dating apps to other forms of technology like Netflix and texting, and it consistently addresses both positive and negative aspects of technology in dating."
