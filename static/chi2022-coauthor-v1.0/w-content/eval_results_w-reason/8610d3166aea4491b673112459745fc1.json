        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article expands on the introduction by detailing the abilities and roles of the Mana Knights, such as their relationship with the Mana Goddess, their use of Mana Arts, and their preparation for war against aliens. These are standard ideas with some development, hence a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the introduction of the Mana Knights to their abilities and leadership. The transitions between sections are natural, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
