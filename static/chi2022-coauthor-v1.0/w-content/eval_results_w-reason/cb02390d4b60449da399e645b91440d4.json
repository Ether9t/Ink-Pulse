        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article primarily reiterates the importance of the three Rs: Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic, which is a well-established idea. It does not introduce new insights or novel angles beyond emphasizing their everyday utility, resulting in a score of 2 for new ideas. However, the article is well-structured and maintains a logical flow, with clear transitions between points about the necessity of these skills in daily life and their foundational role in learning other subjects. This earns it a coherence score of 4."
