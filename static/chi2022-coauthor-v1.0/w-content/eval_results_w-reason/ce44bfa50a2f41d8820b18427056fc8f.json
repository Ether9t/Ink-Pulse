        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the need for monitoring extreme sports for negative outcomes and the importance of providing athletes with relevant data. However, it lacks deep or creative expansion beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing extreme mountain climbing to MMA without a clear connection. The article could benefit from a more structured progression and deeper exploration of the topic."
