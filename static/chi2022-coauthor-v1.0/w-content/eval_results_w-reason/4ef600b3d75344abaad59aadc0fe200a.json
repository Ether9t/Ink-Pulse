        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that ignorance of the news can lead to the spread of misinformation and the potential threat to democracy. However, it doesn't offer particularly novel insights beyond these points, which is why it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from discussing personal views on news consumption to the broader implications of ignorance, earning it a score of 4. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the tone remains consistent throughout."
