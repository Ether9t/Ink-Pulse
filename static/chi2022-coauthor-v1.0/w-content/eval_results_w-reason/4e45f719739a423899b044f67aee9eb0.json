        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that sports are primarily driven by profit, which is a common perspective. It does touch on the notion that the risk is inherent to sports and that the demand for high-risk sports persists due to capitalism, but these are not particularly novel insights. Therefore, the idea score is a 3. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured and maintains a logical flow from discussing the nature of sports as a business to the implications of risk in sports. The transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistent, warranting a coherence score of 4."
