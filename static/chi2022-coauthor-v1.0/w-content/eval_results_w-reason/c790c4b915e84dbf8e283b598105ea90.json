        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed to make well-informed voting decisions and the dangers of populist leaders. These are not particularly novel but are developed with some depth. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure, with a clear progression from the importance of being informed to the consequences of not being informed, and concludes with a strong statement about civic duty. Transitions are smooth, and the argument is consistently developed."
