        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by linking the concept of bee communication and control to blockchain technology, which is a creative and original angle. The notion of bees creating a new cryptocurrency, 'Beecoin', and influencing a data center in Belarus adds to the originality, warranting a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from bee control to the creation of a cryptocurrency, which could have been more smoothly integrated. The stylistic consistency is mostly maintained, but the leap from bee communication to blockchain and cryptocurrency could have been more clearly developed."
