        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to other hygiene products like toilet paper and Band-Aids, and the emphasis on maintaining privacy and confidentiality for students requesting these products. However, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights beyond the introduction. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas. It transitions smoothly from discussing the need for free pads and tampons to comparing them with other hygiene products, and finally to addressing the stigma and privacy concerns, which contributes to a well-structured argument."
