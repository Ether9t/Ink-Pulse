        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, particularly in the twist where the woman is also a shapeshifter. This adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, but it doesn't deeply explore the implications or provide multiple strong original ideas, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is generally coherent with a logical progression from the date to the revelation. However, the transition to the woman's shapeshifting is somewhat abrupt, and the ending feels slightly rushed, which affects the overall flow. Therefore, it receives a coherence score of 3."
