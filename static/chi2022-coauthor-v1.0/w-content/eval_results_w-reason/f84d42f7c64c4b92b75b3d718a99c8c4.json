        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by emphasizing the importance of fostering a love for reading through relatable and engaging texts, which is a novel angle beyond the generic idea of learning to read. It suggests that allowing students to choose their reading materials can ignite passion and imagination, which is a fresh perspective. The coherence is strong, with a well-structured argument that logically progresses from the problem of traditional reading curricula to the proposed solution of personalized reading choices. The article maintains a consistent style and flow, though it could benefit from more examples to illustrate the impact of this approach."
