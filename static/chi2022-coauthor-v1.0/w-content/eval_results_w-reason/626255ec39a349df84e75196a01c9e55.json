        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that uses depleted uranium and robot pigs to outsmart the wolf, which is a creative and original idea. This earns it a high score of 4 for new ideas. The article maintains a coherent narrative with a logical progression from the wolf's arrival to its demise, and the little pig's clever plan is executed smoothly. The transitions between the wolf's interactions with the robot pigs and its eventual transformation are handled well, contributing to a coherence score of 4. However, the article could have been slightly more refined in its stylistic consistency to achieve a perfect score."
