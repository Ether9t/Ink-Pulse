        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, focusing on the father's internal conflict and his conversation with his son about not being the 'number one' dad. It explores the father's self-awareness and his desire to be honest with his son, which adds some depth beyond the introduction. However, it doesn't introduce multiple strong original ideas or deep insights, hence the score of 3 for New Idea. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression from the father's realization to his planned conversation with his son. The transitions are smooth, and the tone is consistent, earning a score of 4 for Coherence."
