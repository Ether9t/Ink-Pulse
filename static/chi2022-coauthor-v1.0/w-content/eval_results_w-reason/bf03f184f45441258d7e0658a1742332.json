        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the concept of a 'Matt Damon Retrieval Team' and the humorous depiction of Matt Damon's talents and the alien's ignorance. However, it doesn't delve deeply into new or original ideas beyond the introduction. The coherence is strong, with a clear narrative structure and logical progression from the alien's kidnapping to the Swiss team's rescue mission. The transitions are smooth, and the tone remains consistent throughout, contributing to a well-structured article."
