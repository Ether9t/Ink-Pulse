        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard exploration of the emotional fallout from discovering a family secret, which is a common narrative theme. The idea score is a 3 because while it develops the initial premise of the mug revealing the true ranking of dads, it doesn't introduce particularly novel insights or creative expansions beyond the expected emotional reactions and family drama. The coherence score is also a 3, as the article generally maintains a logical structure and progression, but there are moments where the transitions between the protagonist's interactions with their parents feel abrupt, and the emotional responses could be more nuanced to enhance the flow."
