        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a continuation of the introduction's premise with some development, such as the U.S. using its isolation to build up nuclear forces and the subsequent global conflict. However, the ideas are not particularly novel or deeply explored, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is also 3, as the article maintains a generally coherent narrative but lacks depth in transitions and logical progression. The abruptness of the U.S.'s actions and the simplistic resolution contribute to occasional unevenness in the narrative."
