        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea by expanding on the humorous premise of Matt Damon being revered as a god-like figure by humans, leading to a trade negotiation with aliens for plastics. This is a creative and original angle, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The coherence is also strong, with a clear narrative progression from the alien's realization of Damon's importance, to the global human reaction, and finally to the trade agreement. The transitions are smooth, and the tone remains consistent, justifying a coherence score of 4."
