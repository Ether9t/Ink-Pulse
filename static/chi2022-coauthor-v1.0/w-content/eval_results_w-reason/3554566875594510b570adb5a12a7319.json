        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the negative impact of technology on dating, such as the loss of face-to-face communication and unrealistic expectations due to media portrayals. These are common critiques and do not offer new insights, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, discussing various aspects of technology's impact on dating. However, it occasionally lacks smooth transitions between points, such as jumping from social media portrayal to dating apps without clear linkage, which affects the flow. Thus, it receives a coherence score of 3."
