        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat shallow exploration of the topic, primarily focusing on the author's personal experiences and assumptions rather than providing new insights or data. The idea score is 2 because it lacks depth and originality, relying on anecdotal evidence and questioning the current situation without offering substantial new perspectives. The coherence score is 3 as the article maintains a general logical structure, but it occasionally shifts abruptly between personal anecdotes and broader societal questions, leading to some unevenness in the narrative."
