        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article introduces a novel concept of golems made of living stone that emerge from a meteor storm and pose a significant threat to humanity and alien civilizations. This idea is a creative expansion beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The article explores the golems' characteristics, such as their ability to heal and reshape, and their lack of strategy, which adds depth to the narrative. However, the coherence score is 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the golems' emergence to their attacks on human and alien settlements. The narrative could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed explanations of the events leading to the golems' attacks."
