        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle on reincarnation by exploring the concept of watching one's future life as a form of preparation, which is a fresh take beyond the introduction. It delves into the psychological impact of witnessing past lives and the potential purpose behind this experience, such as learning from mistakes and the origin of déjà vu. This contributes to a high idea score. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression, moving from the initial shock of the cinema experience to the introspection and eventual readiness for the next life. However, there are minor areas where transitions could be smoother, preventing a perfect score."
