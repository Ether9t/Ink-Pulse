        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that people are more desensitized to human suffering due to media exposure and that personal connections influence decisions in life-or-death scenarios. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and some natural transitions, but there are occasional unevenness and minor stylistic inconsistencies, such as the informal tone and repetitive phrasing ('I think' and 'I personally'). Overall, the article provides a reasonable discussion but does not delve deeply into new ideas or maintain a highly refined structure."
