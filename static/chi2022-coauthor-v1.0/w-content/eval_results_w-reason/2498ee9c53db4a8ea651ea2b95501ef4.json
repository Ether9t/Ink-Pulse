        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a shallow exploration of the consequences of the United States' isolation, primarily focusing on the binary choice of staying isolated or re-establishing contact. The idea score is 2 because it doesn't offer much beyond the introduction's premise, lacking depth or novel insights into the geopolitical or societal impacts of such prolonged isolation. The coherence score is 3 as the article maintains a basic logical structure, but the transitions between the decision points and their consequences are somewhat abrupt and lack detailed exploration, leading to a generally coherent but occasionally uneven narrative."
