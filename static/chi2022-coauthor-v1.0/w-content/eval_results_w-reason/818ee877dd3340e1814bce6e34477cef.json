        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development, such as the global response to the US isolation and the role of Johnathan Wright in orchestrating the non-isolation of other countries. However, it lacks multiple strong original ideas or deep expansion beyond the introduction. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are occasional uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from the US President's declaration to the global response and the environmental improvements. The article could benefit from smoother transitions and more detailed exploration of the consequences of the US's isolation and the global changes."
