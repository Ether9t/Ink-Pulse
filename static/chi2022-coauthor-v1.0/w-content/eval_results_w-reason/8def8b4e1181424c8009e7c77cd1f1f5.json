        "reason": "The article presents a clear new insight by framing screen time as a natural evolution in human social interaction, suggesting that it is a phase of human evolution rather than a temporary issue. This perspective is a novel angle beyond the introduction's question of whether to worry about screen time. The article also introduces the idea that younger generations will adapt and thrive in this digital environment, which adds depth to the discussion. However, it could have explored these ideas more deeply to achieve a perfect score. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a logical progression from embracing screens to discussing generational differences and the future of technology. The transitions are mostly smooth, though there are minor instances where the flow could be improved, such as the abrupt shift from discussing current adaptation to future virtual realities."
