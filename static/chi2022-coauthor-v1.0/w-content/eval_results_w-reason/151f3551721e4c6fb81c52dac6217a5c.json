        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas about the impact of technology on dating, such as the efficiency and convenience of dating apps, and the ability to filter potential partners. These are common points in discussions about online dating, thus earning a score of 3 for new ideas. However, the article does provide some development on these ideas, such as the notion of having a 'whole ocean at your fingertips' compared to a 'small pond.' In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts, moving from personal reliance on dating apps to broader societal acceptance. The transitions are natural, and the style is consistent, justifying a score of 4."
