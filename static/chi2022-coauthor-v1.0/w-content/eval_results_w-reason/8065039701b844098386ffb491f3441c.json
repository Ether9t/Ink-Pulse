        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed to make better personal and community decisions, and the potential risks of ignorance, like moving to a bad neighborhood or missing travel advisories. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence is strong, with a logical structure and clear progression from one point to the next, such as moving from local to global examples. However, the article could benefit from more varied examples or deeper exploration of the topic to enhance originality."
