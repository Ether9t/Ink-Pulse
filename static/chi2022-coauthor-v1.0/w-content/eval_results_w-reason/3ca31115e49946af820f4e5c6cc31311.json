        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and engages in a philosophical and darkly comedic dialogue with a wolf. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article maintains a generally coherent narrative, there are some abrupt shifts in tone, such as the sudden introduction of Mother Pig and the revelation that the wolf is actually a puppy. These transitions could be smoother to enhance the overall flow."
