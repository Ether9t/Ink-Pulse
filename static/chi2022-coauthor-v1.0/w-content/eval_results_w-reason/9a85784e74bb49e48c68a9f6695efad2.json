        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of being informed to form well-thought-out opinions and the civic duty to stay updated. However, it lacks novel insights or creative expansion beyond these points, which is why it scores a 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains logical structure and stylistic consistency throughout, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
