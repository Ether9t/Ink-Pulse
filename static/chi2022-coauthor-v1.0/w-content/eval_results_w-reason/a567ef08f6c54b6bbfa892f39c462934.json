        "idea_score": 2,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a somewhat predictable narrative of a shapeshifter pursuing a woman, which lacks significant originality beyond the introduction. The idea of a shapeshifter repeatedly trying to win over the same woman is not deeply explored, and the resolution is fairly conventional, leading to a score of 2 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a generally logical structure, following the progression of the woman's relationships and eventual resolution. However, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden leap from the wedding day disaster to the woman's life ten years later, which affects the flow. Therefore, the coherence score is 3."
