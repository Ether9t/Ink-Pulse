        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea with some development beyond the introduction. The concept of a shapeshifter repeatedly dating the same woman is intriguing, but the article doesn't delve deeply into the implications or explore new angles beyond the initial setup. The twist of the boyfriend being a shapeshifter from another solar system adds a layer of novelty, but it is not fully explored or developed. Coherence is generally maintained, but there are moments of unevenness, such as the abrupt transition from the woman's realization to the boyfriend's explanation. The narrative flow is mostly logical, but the resolution feels rushed and lacks depth, impacting the overall coherence."
