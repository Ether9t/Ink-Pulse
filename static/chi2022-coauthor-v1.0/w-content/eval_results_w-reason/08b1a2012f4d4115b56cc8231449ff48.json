        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion of personal freedom and consent in engaging in extreme sports, and the comparison to other risky activities like smoking or speeding. However, it lacks deep exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and some natural transitions, but there are occasional unevenness and informal tone shifts, such as the hyperbolic comparison to riding a school bus and the casual mention of 'granny panties.' Overall, the article is coherent but not exceptionally refined."
