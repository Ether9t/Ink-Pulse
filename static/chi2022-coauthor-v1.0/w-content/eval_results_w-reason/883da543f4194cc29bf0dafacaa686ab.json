        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that humans should be prioritized over animals due to their higher place in the 'totem pole of life.' It also touches on the idea that empathy towards humans could improve societal issues, which adds some depth. However, these ideas are not particularly novel or groundbreaking, hence the score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It maintains a logical flow from discussing empathy towards animals to the importance of human welfare, earning it a score of 4 for coherence."
