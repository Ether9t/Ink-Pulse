        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of technology on dating. It discusses the benefits of dating apps and other technologies like Netflix, social media, and texting in facilitating romantic connections. However, these insights are relatively common and lack novel angles, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression of thoughts. It maintains logical flow and transitions smoothly between discussing dating apps and other technologies, though it could be more stylistically refined to achieve a perfect score."
