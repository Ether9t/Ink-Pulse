        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the issue of stereotypical characters, particularly focusing on the 'magical negro' trope and tokenism. While these are not entirely new concepts, the article does provide a clear critique of lazy writing and the need for well-rounded characters, which adds some depth to the discussion. The coherence score is high because the article maintains a logical structure and natural transitions throughout. It consistently builds on the initial point about offensive portrayals and concludes with a call for diverse and well-developed characters, maintaining stylistic consistency."
