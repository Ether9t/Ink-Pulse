        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig who builds a house out of depleted uranium, leading to unexpected consequences for the wolf. This is a clear new insight beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. The narrative explores themes of forgiveness and friendship, which are developed in a creative manner. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the wolf's illness to the party invitation and the pig's thoughtful gesture of wearing an iron lung. The dialogue and interactions between the characters are consistent and contribute to the story's flow, justifying a coherence score of 4."
