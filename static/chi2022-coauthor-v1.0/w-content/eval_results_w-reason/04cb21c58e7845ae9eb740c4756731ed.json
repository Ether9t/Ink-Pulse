        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison between listening to an audiobook and reading a book as watching versus directing a movie in your head. It also touches on the educational benefits of reading, like vocabulary expansion and problem-solving skills. However, these insights are not particularly novel. The coherence is generally maintained, but there are some uneven transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing mental engagement to the sensory experience of books (e.g., the smell of a book). Overall, the article is coherent but lacks deep or creative expansion beyond the introduction."
