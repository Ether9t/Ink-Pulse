        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the importance of social skills and discovering personal interests in school. These are not particularly novel but are well-articulated. The coherence is strong, with a clear structure and logical progression from discussing social skills to job market preparation. The transitions between points are smooth, and the article maintains a consistent style throughout."
