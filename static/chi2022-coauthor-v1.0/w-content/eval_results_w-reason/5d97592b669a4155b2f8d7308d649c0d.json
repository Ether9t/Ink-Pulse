        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing a pig that builds a house out of depleted uranium and involves a nuclear testing ground, which is a creative and original idea. The concept of the wolf being tricked by pigs disguised as lions adds another layer of originality, earning it a high idea score of 4. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the story generally follows a logical progression, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden appearance of lions disguised as pigs and the nuclear explosion, which could have been more smoothly integrated into the narrative."
