        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel idea of a 'Presidential Afterlife' where former presidents are cloned and work together to prevent global catastrophes, which is a creative expansion beyond the introduction. This concept of using time travel and cloning to avert disasters adds a unique twist to the narrative. However, the coherence score is slightly lower because while the article maintains a general logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden introduction of JFK and the explanation of the department's purpose, which could have been more smoothly integrated. Overall, the article is imaginative but could benefit from more refined transitions."
