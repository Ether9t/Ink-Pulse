        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel and humorous twist on the classic 'Three Little Pigs' story by introducing the concept of a pig dealing in depleted uranium, which is an unexpected and creative angle. This originality earns it a high idea score of 4. The narrative explores the pig's interaction with the wolf and their subsequent business venture, which is a fresh take on the traditional tale. In terms of coherence, the article maintains a logical structure and natural progression from the wolf's curiosity to the business partnership. The dialogue between the pig and the wolf is consistent and helps to develop the plot smoothly, justifying a coherence score of 4. However, the article could have been more detailed in exploring the implications of their business, which would have enhanced both the depth of ideas and the overall coherence."
