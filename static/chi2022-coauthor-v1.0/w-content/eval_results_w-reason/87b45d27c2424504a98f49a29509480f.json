        "idea_score": 4,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents a novel angle by introducing the concept of a counterdrug that reverses the sterilization effects but not the aging effects, leading to a unique societal dynamic where women rapidly age. This adds depth beyond the introduction, earning a score of 4 for new ideas. However, the coherence score is a 3 because while the article generally maintains a logical structure, there are some abrupt transitions, such as the sudden shift from the societal impact of sterility to the development and effects of the counterdrug, which could have been more smoothly integrated."
