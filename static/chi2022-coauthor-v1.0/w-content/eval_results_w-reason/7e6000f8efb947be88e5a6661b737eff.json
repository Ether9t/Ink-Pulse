        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 3,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the notion that it's okay to take a break from the news and that people often hear about news through social media or word of mouth. These are not particularly novel insights but are developed to some extent. The coherence is generally maintained, with a logical structure and natural transitions, though there are occasional unevenness and repetition, such as the repeated emphasis on tuning out negative news and focusing on personal well-being. Overall, the article is coherent but lacks deep or creative expansion beyond the introduction."
