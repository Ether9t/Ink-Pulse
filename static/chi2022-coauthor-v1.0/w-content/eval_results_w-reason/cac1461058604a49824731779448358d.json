        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the author's preference for visual learning and the tactile experience of reading physical books. It also touches on the utility of audiobooks in specific situations like driving or commuting. However, it doesn't offer particularly novel insights beyond these points, resulting in a score of 3 for new ideas. In terms of coherence, the article is well-structured with a clear progression from personal preference to specific examples and counterarguments. The transitions are mostly smooth, and the article maintains a consistent tone, earning it a coherence score of 4."
