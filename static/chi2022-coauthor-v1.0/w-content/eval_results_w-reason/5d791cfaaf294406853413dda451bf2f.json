        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents a standard idea that science is crucial for critical thinking and rationality, which is a common perspective. It does not introduce multiple strong original ideas or deep insights beyond the introduction, hence the idea score of 3. However, it does develop the idea by discussing the scientific method and its application to life, which adds some depth. The coherence score is 4 because the article is well-structured with a clear progression from the importance of science to its impact on human progress and future potential. The transitions are natural, and the argument is consistently developed, though it lacks the seamless flow required for a perfect score."
