        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development regarding the impact of stereotypical characters, particularly focusing on their offensive nature and the author's personal choice to avoid such media. It does not introduce particularly novel insights but does expand on the introduction by discussing the author's personal stance and the broader societal implications of stereotypes. The coherence score is higher as the article is well-structured with a clear, natural progression of ideas. It maintains a logical flow from discussing the types of stereotypes that are problematic to the personal and societal impacts, and finally to the author's viewing choices."
