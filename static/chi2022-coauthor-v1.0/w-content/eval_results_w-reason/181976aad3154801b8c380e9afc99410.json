        "idea_score": 3,
        "coherence_score": 4,
        "reason": "The article presents standard ideas with some development, such as the comparison of pads and tampons to other hygiene products like toilet paper and soap, and the emphasis on making school a comfortable environment for female students. However, it lacks deeper exploration or novel insights beyond these points. The coherence score is higher because the article maintains a logical structure and clear progression of ideas, with smooth transitions between points. The argument is consistently developed, and the tone remains steady throughout."
