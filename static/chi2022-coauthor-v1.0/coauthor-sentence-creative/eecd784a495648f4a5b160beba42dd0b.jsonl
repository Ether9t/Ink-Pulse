With it was a note: thanks for being such a great father and taking me to the Mets game. Love, your son.\n\nIn his basement, Joe looks at the mug. Before his eyes, the legend \"World's #1 Dad\" seems to waver, and then it changes. It now reads: \"World's Worst Dad.\" For some reason, he finds this funny. He laughs and laughs.\n\nHe laughs mostly because he realizes that he is not the World's Worst Dad. But he is an alcoholic. And if he ever wants to take his son anywhere, something had better change.\n\nThe next morning, Joe goes to first his AA meeting. He tells his story. He tells it honestly. He tells it without shame. He tells it without fear. He tells it without anger. And he tells it without a drink in his hand.\n\nLater that day, he goes to pick up his son after school. He is sober. At first his son is aloof, but suddenly he rushes his father and encircles him with his arms, crying. \"Dad, I've missed you,\" he chokes out.\n\nJoe holds his son.\n",
