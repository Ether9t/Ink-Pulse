In general, Out of Exile is a well-balanced game, and it's not too difficult to complete even on the hardest difficulty settings.The game is divided into three main campaigns, each one having its own set of levels. Although most of the levels are on-rails and do not allow free roaming around, there are some notable exceptions, one being a mission in which the player controls a tank and the other being a mission which takes place in an abandoned mine.\n",
