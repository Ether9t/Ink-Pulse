He has her thinking he's a real superhero now, with superpowers. Whenever they meet up, he pretends he has just saved the life of an innocent stranger who was in trouble. Can she ever see through his charade? And why won't he tell her who he really is? One day she sees him out and later catches him in a lie about his superhero activities. She confronts him, and he reveals the truth. She doesn't believe him at first because it just sounds like more superhero nonsense. He's able to convince her it's the truth by showing her his true form. He becomes invisible. The woman can't believe her eyes. \"But how do I know the others were also you?\" she asked. He shows her all his other forms as proof it was him. She is blown away by this. She thinks really hard about why it never worked out with the others.
