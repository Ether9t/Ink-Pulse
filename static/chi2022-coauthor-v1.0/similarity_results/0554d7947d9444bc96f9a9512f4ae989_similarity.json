She seemed more happy and more energetic than me. After all, she died way earlier than me. I felt happy for her because she didn't have to worry about problems like me. After some time that we were talking, she asked me, \"How about you?\"\n\n\"How about me, what?\" I asked.\n\n\"How did you die?\" she said.\n\nThat is the question that I was dreading to answer. I did not have a carefree life the way she had. I was always worried about the future, I was always thinking about what would happen if I did this or that. I was worried about my mortgage, my bills, the people around me. In the end, I had too much of it and decided to end my life.\n\n\"I.. I committed suicide.\" I regrettably said to her.  Understandably she got very quiet. Her face suddenly felt that it was sad and she started to cry. \"I'm sorry, I did not intend to make you feel sad.\" I said.\n\n\"You didn't, I wish I didn't die the way I did.\" she said while she was still crying. \"I didn't realize how lucky I was until I saw how unhappy you were in your life. I wasted mine.\"\n\nTears came down my eyes too as we felt silent and just continued watching the movie screen. After a few moments, we saw another version of us enter the movie theater and another movie started playing.",
