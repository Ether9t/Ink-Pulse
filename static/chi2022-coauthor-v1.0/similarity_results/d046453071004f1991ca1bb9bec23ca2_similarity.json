Sometimes the movie's portrayal of you will not be accurate and this is to be expected. After all, the movie is a reflection of your life as seen through the eyes of the people who were in your life. This means that the movie could in some ways be a bit distorted. You might feel betrayed in the way that some people view you and your life story, if others' perceptions don't align with your own. \n\nHowever, even if the movie is not an accurate portrayal of your life, it is still a good idea to watch it. This is because this exercise can be a hugely transformative experience. It is also a humbling one, as it's so rare to get an objective third party view of yourself. \n\nThe movie that plays at your life's end is also a good opportunity to reflect on your life.",
