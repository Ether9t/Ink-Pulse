You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. As you watch yourself go through life this time around, your past lives begin to slip away. With each new life previous lives become more distant.\n\nYou begin wo wonder what is in store for your next life? Will it be the same as one of your previous lives? You will probably look similar but will you know the same people? Will you live in the same town? Will your choice of partner seem as inexplicable as it did in a previous life?\n\nThere is much in your previous lives that seems inexplicable but you have heard everything happens for a reason. You are comforted by the thought that each life has led up to this one. You know that wherever you go that is where you are supposed to be. \n\nYou remember the previous life in which your pet dog died. You really hope in this life you will meet again. \n\nYou suddenly have a thought. Maybe each time you live you will have more love to give. In this life the love you have for a dog will be that dog as well as all other dogs you have ever had.\n\nMaybe one day you will even be able to love yourself. It has been hard because you carry thoughts of all the things you wish you had done.  You decide this next life will be the best yet. You will forgive yourself for prior failures and bring all of your experience into this next life.\n\nIn this next life you have more love to give than ever before. You not only have a dog but you are a veterinarian that gets to heal dogs. This is the life you had always wanted but never allowed yourself to live. You hope this life will last forever but you know you will never forget the experiences and bring them to your next life too.",
