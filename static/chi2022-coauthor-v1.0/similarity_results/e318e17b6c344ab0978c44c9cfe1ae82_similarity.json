Amy thinks this is selfish of the parents. The children will be able to care for themselves and will make their own way eventually. What the parents do not know is that the government is not giving people a choice.\n\n\nTim and Jim decide, with the help of Amy, to live off the grid. They will not allow the government to use their precious offspring as guinea pigs. Amy agrees, somewhat. She thinks that staying away from the mainstream will give her two years to observe side effects. If they are a nightmare, she will simply stay off the grid. Amy loves the little ones for whom she cares. She could be happy always being in their life. In fact, it is ideal for children to have two loving parents, and a fun, creative and loving governess. This just might turn out okay, afterall.\n",
