So, Matt and Soeurette end up living the rest of their lives together, but it's a little uncomfortable because underneath their relationship is always the tension that Matt had habitually cheated on Soeurette for so much of their relationship, and that Soeurette had always been too idiotic to notice. So, this story's moral is that people should always go into relationships with their eyes wide open. ",
