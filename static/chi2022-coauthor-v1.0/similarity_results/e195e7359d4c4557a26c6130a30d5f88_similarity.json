It's two more black suited men. One of them looks up at you. \"Please, Mister Obama, you should come with us.\" You turn aside in disgust, give up on gardening for the moment, and head back to the house.\n\nYou open the door, and are surprised to find that the lights are out. Suddenly, you know a moment of fear. Is it possible this whole thing has been some kidnapping, or assassination plot by right wing nutjobs? You fumble for the switch, and turn on the light.\n\nThe light goes on, and you're stunned to see John F.

You're eating a piece of toast when you hear the doorbell ring. You sigh, and put down the toast, and answer the door. It's a man in a black suit. \"Who are you, and what do you want?\" you ask him. \"I'm here to help you pack,\" he says. \"For what?
