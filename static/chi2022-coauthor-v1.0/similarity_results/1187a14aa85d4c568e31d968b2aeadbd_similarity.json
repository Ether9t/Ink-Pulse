        "sentence": "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. The alien has held him hostage in the woods outside of his spaceship. The alien is unaware that Matt Damon is a famous actor and that his kidnapping is a huge deal. He wants to keep him so his species can learn more about humans. \n\nThe alien has a lot of questions for Matt Damon. He asked Matt Damon about what things he ate and what he did during the day as a human. The alien is fascinated by the fact that Matt Damon is a human and that he is so different from him.\nMeanwhile, the people now know that Mr. Damon is missing and a report of it has even been seen on the news. The people are very worried about him and they are trying to find him. After about a week, the alien sees this on his spaceship's tv transmitter. He knows the humans will eventually come for him. He decides to let Matt Damon go.\nMatt Damon went home and told all the people, even the news reporters, the story about the alien. He told them how the alien had kidnapped him and how he was very nice to him. All the alien really wanted to do is learn about humans and their culture. The people were very happy that Matt Damon was safe and that the alien was not a threat to them. To show their gratitude, the people allowed the alien to visit in a nearby area, so he could learn even more about Matt Damon and his people. The alien was able to taste delicious food and listen to music played by the people. He hung out with Matt Damon and his friends for a few days. He was very happy to be able to learn more about humans.\n\nThe alien was sad to say goodbye to Matt Damon and his friends. But he had gotten all he had come to earth for. He climbed in his spaceship and took off happy about his journey to Earth. The End.",
