He is able to recruit a man named Stuart, who is a former member of the U.S. military, and a man named Charlie, who is a former member of the U.S. Air Force. This is the perfect group of people since Stuart and Charlie have extensive vet experience. Now that John has assembled his team, he is able to begin his plan of action. \n\nJohn's plan is to attack the Chinese and the Soviets from the inside. He and his team will go into the Rocky Mountains and set up a base of operations there. From there, they will be able to launch attacks against the Soviets and the Chinese. It's really the ideal setup, because the Soviets and the Chinese are completely unaware of the fact that there is a resistance movement against them. When it's time to put the plan into action, John and his team begin to make their way to the Rocky Mountains. \n\nJohn and his team are able to make it to the Rocky Mountains without being detected by the Soviets or the Chinese. There, they set up a base of operations, and they begin to launch attacks against the Soviets and the Chinese. They are able to do so with relative ease, and they are able to do so without being detected. \n\nJohn and his team are able to launch a number of successful attacks against the Soviets and the Chinese. They are able to destroy a number of Soviet and Chinese supply depots, and they are able to destroy a number of Chinese and Soviet supply trains. The Chinese and Soviets are not able to figure out who is attacking them, and they are not able to figure out where the attacks are coming from.",
