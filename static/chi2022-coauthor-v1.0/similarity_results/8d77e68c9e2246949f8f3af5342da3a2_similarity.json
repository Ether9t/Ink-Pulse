So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes. You know the story about the first three little pigs. This is a story about the 92nd little pig.\n\nThe 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium. And the wolf was like, \"dude.",

Everytime that the wolf would come by would always be for a reason either to make fun of the pig, remind the pig of his famous three brothers, or to simply annoy him. Needless to say, the wolf did not hold a good place in the pig's heart. \"Where can i go to get the material to make a house like this?\" Said the wolf. \"I am not sure. I just looked around in the forest for the most part\" said the pig. The wolf did not believe the pig, and you could see it on his face. \" I guess ill just go look in the forest then....\" the wolf said sarcastically. Just like that the wolf ran off to the forest and the pig gladly shut the door of his home. The pig was very familiar with what it was like to have the wolf repeatedly come over and mess with him, however this time he truly had built a grand home. \n\nA week or so later the pig looked outside his window and could see the wolf rebuilding his own home. The wolf started from scratch and aimed to make a home stronger than the pigs. There was a knock on the door at that instant. The 92nd pig opened the door. Low and behold it was his three famous brothers. \"Hi guys, what brings you in town!?!\" says the 92nd pig. \"Hey! We heard about your new home and we just wanted to come by and say congratulations.\" The 92nd pig knew there was something fishy, as he had not seen his brothers in years. \"Are you guys ok?\" the 92nd pig asked. The three pigs all stood there in silence. \"Our house burned down.\" They all said in unison. The 92nd pig was astonished. \"You guys can stay here if you like\" the 92nd pig stated. The three brothers accepted in glee, and the four brothers continued to have a great evening of catching up and reminiscing. ",
