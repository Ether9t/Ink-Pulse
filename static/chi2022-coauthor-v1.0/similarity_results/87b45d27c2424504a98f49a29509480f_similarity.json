One woman, Soeurette Morley, decides to go on a rampage against the government by creating her own counterdrug. She is able to create a drug that reverses the effects of the original drug. She is able to reverse the sterilization effects of the original drug, but she is unable to reverse the aging effects. As a result, everyone who she administers the counterdrug to rapidly ages to become their real, true age. This means that women who had become very accustomed to looking perpetually 28 now look 75. They are devastated because their husbands still look 28 and now they feel like cougars. ",
