Using the Consciousness as a weapon, they begin to fight back against those who would see them destroyed.\n\nThey come up with a timed attack. They strike at the same times in every location and hit the Ethereals where they least expect it. This is successful. It catches them off guard. But it does not finish them off. They then have to focus their attacks more. People have to travel to join larger groups to take down the largest of the aliens. They have to work together to survive. They need to work together to end this. \n\nIt takes some time but they finally take down the larger aliens and free the earth from this invasion. But it is not without great cost. Humans are a much smaller population now. Many people like this new power that they share. A movement starts that wants to ban people from having children because it would lesson their power. Without children in the future, the Consciousness would be even stronger. \n\nThis splits the world into two groups, those who want to repopulate and those who do not. These two sides go to war. It causes even more death. The people who do not want to repopulate get the advantage. They then end up wiping out the other group. \n\nThe survivors then begin killing each other, thinking that they may gain new powers if there are less people. This continues until there is one human left, who realizes there were no extra powers. They have the ultimate collective mind to share with no one else. ",
