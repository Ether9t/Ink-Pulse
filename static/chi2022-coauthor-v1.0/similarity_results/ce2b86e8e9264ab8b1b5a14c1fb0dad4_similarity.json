You can do it anonymously as they are all set up on a server. Nobody knows about this server because JFK has been making it his life's work. When he got elected as President he wanted to work for the people. Instead he was basically acting as a pawn for this secret society of sorts. \n\nYou think it over and decide that releasing these files would be too big of a risk. You could get in trouble and the public's reaction to it could actually hurt them as well. You politely decline JFKs offer.\n\nUnbeknownst to you, just a few weeks later you see a news brief. JFK ended up releasing the files under an alias and there was havoc in the streets. The people no longer trusted the government. This is exactly what you feared. You wondered why JFK would do this. You called the number that he left you and there was no answer. The phone was disconnected. You're left sitting there asking yourself why this happened, and sadly no answer is ever coming. ",
