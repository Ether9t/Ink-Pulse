Then, I want you to go to a shooting range and learn how to use it. Then call me back.\n\nJFK\n\nSo you go to the nearest gun store, and buy a Glock, and fill out the paperwork while the secret service detail rolls their eyes, and the gun store owner smirks. You also buy a box of ammunition, and luckily there's a range attached to the gun store, so you put in a pretty good day of shooting, and practicing.\n\nThen, you get another letter.  \"Now, I want you to go to the White House, and kill everyone in the Oval Office.\" \"But that's just Joe Biden, and maybe that ugly woman who's vice president.\" \"I know.\" says the voice.\n\nShrugging, you get in the limo and take the ride to the White House to meet your fate. This probably won't end well, but it beats spending the next 40 years throwing Covid parties at Martha's Vinyard.",
