You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. You can’t escape as you’re glued to your seat. After it’s done you are taken forward to live your next life. That can be a bit scary and even sad for some of us.\n\nNot everyone wants to be reincarnated. Not everyone wants to come back to this Earth. But reincarnation allows us to experience many different lives. It allows us to experience all the different roles we can play. It allows us to be a parent, to be a child, to be an animal or plant. Anything is possible with reincarnation.\n\nSome people believe that reincarnation is like going from one room into another, and then you decide if you want to go back to the original. We also get to choose our next life, including the place where we will live and who we will be. Those people believe that we have some control over our life. Others believe that we are reincarnated into something or someone by random chance. Whatever your belief is, reincarnation allows us to experience the many different roles we can play.\n\nWhat is it like to be a ghost? \n\nTo be a ghost is to be in purgatory. But it is not a painful experience, it is just very quiet and calm. It is almost like being in suspended animation. There is no time, there are no seasons, there is no physical pain. It's an interesting experience to say the least, and one many humans fear. The universe that we live on is the only one we know. The unknown can be very scary to our minds. \n\nWe are social creatures, and we feel safe in our own realm. To move on from the physical body is very challenging for many people. We have a comfort in our physical body. Many people are afraid to live off as a spirit in the spiritual world. They are used to their physical body. It is a safe feeling for a human. \n\nSome humans have the belief that when we die and move on, we go to a better place. That is the most comforting thought in regards to death. To many people, the afterlife is better than this Earth. Getting to spend life with the Holy Father, the Lord, God is what they believe their life's purpose is. Heaven is a wonderful place to be.",
