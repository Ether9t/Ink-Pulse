She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. Her name is Lucy and she has a disorder called temporary amnesia where she totally forgets that she keeps on seeing the same guy. The guy's name is Jake and he's generally quite good at changing his identity up to keep Lucy off of his tracks. For example, sometimes he'll bump into Lucy at a coffee bar and he'll make some excuse for how he's really a coffee fiend. Other times he'll bump into Lucy at a bookstore and say he's really a lover of all books. And other times he bumps into her at a park and says he's really a nature lover. It really depends on where he bumps into Lucy. And he always makes up a new name and identity to go with his new hobby. But Lucy always forgets and falls for him all over again, even though Jake really doesn't change up his appearance at all. He's always the same guy.\n\nAnyways, the issue with Jake is that he's a bit of a loser. He can't really hold a steady job. Whenever he takes Lucy out for a date, he always has to borrow money from his friend, Doug. And oftentimes, Jake doesn't even have enough money to pay Doug back. Sometimes, Jake has to borrow money from Doug just to pay Lucy back for the date. It's a little embarrassing to Lucy that her date cannot even pay for a Chipotle burrito bowl for himself, let alone for the two of them. In fact, Jake is so broke that he has to borrow money from Doug just to pay for the gas to drive to Lucy's house. It's a little ridiculous to Lucy but she keeps forgetting Jake's issues because she is so smitten that a man could have so many hobbies in common with her. \n\nLucy and Jake's relationship is a bit of a mess. But one day, Jake has made up his mind that he's really going to make it work with Lucy. He puts on a suit and takes Lucy out for a nice dinner. At dinner, he orders a bottle of wine and he's really trying to impress Lucy. For his entree, he orders the lobster, which is the most expensive thing on the menu. When he asks what Lucy wants, she initially says she wants the chicken, but Jake tells her that he's going to order the lobster and that she should too. Lucy is concerned that she's going to be on the hook to pay for the dinner. But Jake tells her that he's going to pay for the dinner, and that she should order whatever she wants. Lucy whispers, \"Really?\" and Jake says, \"Yeah, I'm going to pay for it.\" So Lucy orders the lobster, but she's still a bit concerned that Jake is going to have to borrow money from Doug to pay for the dinner.
