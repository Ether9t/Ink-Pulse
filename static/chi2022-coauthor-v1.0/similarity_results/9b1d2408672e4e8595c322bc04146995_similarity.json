You will be able to help people, to make a real difference in the world. \n\nYou hope that your compassion for others will remain in tact after you are reborn. As you begin to dream of your new life, you wonder if growing up rich will make it harder for you to have empathy for others. You hope that you will still be able to feel the pain of others, and you wonder if you will be able to help people who are less fortunate than you. You look for your reincarnation mentor to ask questions, but they are nowhere to be found. \n\nYou begin to have second thoughts about your chosen path in life. Maybe it would be better to be born poor and work your way up, just in case the rich life has a greater chance of ignorance about the challenges of others. But what if you never end up making the fortune you have been promised in your current choice? It's a difficult decision to make, and you're not even sure that the decision can be changed at this point.\n\nAfter mulling over your conundrum, your reincarnation mentor appears. You ask them whether you are able to change your mind and be born poor instead. They tell you that you are able to change your mind, but that you will lose all of your memories of your previous life if you do. That made the decision very easy. If you can be born rich and retain your memories, that means you should still be compassionate. Confident in your decision to be born to a wealthy family, you close your eyes and wait to meet your new parents. You couldn't wait to make this your best life.",
