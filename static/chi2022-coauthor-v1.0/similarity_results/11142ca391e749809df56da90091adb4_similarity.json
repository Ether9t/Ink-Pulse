It's the health department!\" \nThe 92nd little pig recognized his voice, so he said, \"No thanks, wolf. I'm healthy as a pig!\" \n\nThe wolf said, \"Oh, I'm sorry. I must have the wrong address.\" And he walked away. But the wolf knew that the little pig would go to visit his neighbor, so he waited outside the next house. And as soon as the 92nd little pig walked out, he snuck up and put a bag over his head and took him away. \n\nThe wolf put the 92nd little pig in a big pot and started to heat the water. But the 92nd little pig was smart. He managed to squirm his way to the edge of the pot, and when he did, he grabbed a nearby radio antenna and pulled it out. The antenna was attached to the city's radio station, and when he pulled it out, all of the city's residents could hear him screaming for help!\n\nSo the people of the city stormed the wolf's house and rescued the 92nd little pig. And when the 92nd little pig got home, he wrote a book called \"How to Build an Igloo Out of Uranium\" which became a bestseller. But then he got cancer.  And then he got cancer again. And again. \nSo while his family lived happily ever after, free of the scourge of the wolf, the little pig had to live his life hooked up to an IV drip, slowly dying of cancer.  When he died, he was revered as a saint among pigs, and children sang his praises for saving them from the evil wolf. ",
