Before the world went to pot,  the Keepers of Mana were able to skype and communicate via messenger and social media. They learned the magic spells and ways and kept written journals of what they discovered. This small group knew the time was coming when this power would be needed, and the had to be sure they were ready.\n\n",

Mana gathers it's strength from everyone collectively reaching towards the same goal, which is getting rid of the aliens.
