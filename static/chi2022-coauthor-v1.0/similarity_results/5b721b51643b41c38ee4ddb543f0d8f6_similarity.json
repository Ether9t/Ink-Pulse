I assure you that In ever died and me being right here is the proof!\". She said, \"Oh, well, wow, I'm so glad that you're ok!\". He replied, \"Thank you. So am I!\". Then she decided to go back home and tell her boyfriend about what just happened. \n\nLittle does she know that the man that she thought had died was actually the man that she's dating now. He just pretended to have died in order to become another man for her to date. So the woman went home and told her boyfriend everything. The boyfriend acted like he was empathetic and said that the man's really lucky to be alive. He also said, \"I know it sounds bad, but I'm glad that he died and that you didn't end up with that guy otherwise we wouldn't be together.\". \"Don't say that! That's so mean!\", she replies. \"Don't worry. I'm just kidding!\" he says. They watch a movie together and end up falling asleep on the couch. A few hours later she wakes up, turns to look at her boyfriend and sees that his face is the face of the man who she thought had died!

It's the closest solar system to the Milky Way Galaxy with human like life. We're like humans here but just more advanced since we've lived 1,000,000 years more than you have. Please let me show you.\" He then shape shifts back into the boyfriend that she knows and she faints. He tries to wake her up and when she finally wakes up she says, \"Oh my god. I had the most horrible dream! You were a shapeshifter from a different solar system who had shape shifted into a man I had previously dated, the one that I told you about that I thought had died in the car crash years ago.\" \"My god!\" the boyfriend says. \"I think you need to drink some water. Here, drink up and relax and clear your head. It was just a dream.\" She says, \"Yeah it was just a dream. Thank God!\".\n\nFrom that day on, the boyfriend was extremely careful to not get caught with his face changed ever again and they continued to date and their love remained strong. She never found out that he was a shapeshifter who had previously been her boyfriend many times before. ",
