Since this bee was nice and didn't sting me, I was eager to help. I agreed to be their queen. I had quite the task of finding this evil queen so that I could destroy her. I had to go through a lot of obstacles to get to her, but I was determined to save my hive. My first obstacle was a giant spider web.  I used a stick and I got the spider web out of the way of the hive. My second obstacle was a giant bear. Apparently he wanted the honey made by the bees and didn't want to hurt me. I told the bear I was just after the evil queen and I wouldn't take any of the honey so he let me go. I told the bear if he would help me, I bet the bees would give him some honey and the little bee in the suit agreed. So the bear agreed to help me catch the evil queen. ",
