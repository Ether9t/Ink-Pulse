You suddenly feel like you can do anything: talk to anyone, learn anything, love anyone. You've never felt like this.\n\nYou have a sudden thought. What if you sprinkle it on yourself? You do this, and suddenly you are no longer sitting in a cinema.\nYou are sitting on an unfamiliar beach, but it looks like the beach from your dreams.
