The aliens then launch a last-ditch attempt to destroy the humans on Earth, but this too ends fail as the humans fight back with considerable strength. Once humans have successfully defended themselves on Earth, they send a radio signal up to the Watchers of the Earth to let them know that they can come back down. Interestingly, the Watchers of the Earth do not come down immediately and that is because of their loss of memory and hallucinations. Upon receiving the radio signal directing them to return to Earth, the Watchers promptly forget it. And later, when the radio signal comes through with the same instruction again, the Watchers of the Earth end up hallucinating that the radio signal was falsely sent. So as a result, the Watchers spend an additional year watching over the Earth even though they are not actually doing anything productive with their time as there are no threats remaining against the humans on Earth. When the Watchers finally return back to Earth, they are greeted with less fanfare than they would have expected. They realize that the attacks from the aliens ended a year ago and feel dumb for having failed to heed the first radio signal. However, they are still recognized as an important component of the effort to save the humans, and for this they are bestowed medals. The Watchers feel proud to have contributed to the effort.",
