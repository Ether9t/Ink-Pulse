        "sentence": "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. This woman's name is Lilybelle and she lives with a psychic parrot named Toots. Toots decides he's going to help Lilybelle end this crazy dating cycle. \n\nToots uses his psychic powers to read the stars, thereby predicting Lilybelle's romantic future. \nToots, however is really bad at this. He's also really bad at math, so his predictions are always off. He can't seem to figure out how to get Lilybelle the right man at the right time. He can't seem to put her in a room with a man who will fit her life parameters. He can't seem to get her out of a relationship when he knows it isn't right. The only thing Toots is good at is getting Lilybelle into trouble.\n\n\"Lilybelle,\" says Toots one day. \"You're going to find the perfect man for you today.\" \n\n\"Finally,\" groans Lilybelle. \"Let's hope he's perfect.\" \n\nToots takes off and Lilybelle heads to work. On her way, she stops in a store to buy some groceries. She meets a man in the bakery section of the store. They strike up a conversation and he offers to carry her groceries to her car. He's perfect on paper; he's handsome, he has a great job, and he seems to really like her. He also seems to be exactly what she wants in a man. He even offers to take her out on their first date that night. \n\nLilybelle rushes home to prepare herself for her date. For once, Toots might be right about something, and what a happy surprise this is to her. She starts to get dressed, but without looking closely at her clothes, something catches her eye. She looks down and sees a large stain on her blouse. \"There's no way I'm going out with this guy looking like this,\" she says to herself. She's annoyed because obviously, this might be a bad omen for things to come with this guy. Regardless, Lilybelle is a trooper and gets her laundry done. \"Where is your date?\" Toots asks. \"We have a reservation at the Olive Garden,\" she replies. \n\nToots feels a pang of jealousy, because Olive Garden is his favorite restaurant. When Lilybelle's date arrives, the guy is quite nice and charming, and Toots can tell he really likes Lilybelle. Toots feels happy for Lilybelle and goes off to play hide and seek with some neighborhood kids. \n\nAt the Olive Garden, Lilybelle orders her favorite meal, shrimp scampi, and her date orders the chicken parmesan. They both share a plate of breadsticks. After dinner, Lilybelle suggests they go back to her place, so they can relax and enjoy each other's company, if you know what that means. They get back to her place and start getting cozy. \"Let's get on the couch,\" says Lilybelle. \"I want to cuddle.\" \n\nShe pulls him onto the couch and they start getting really close. She inches her hand onto his thigh and feels something she's never felt before. Her hand feels a bulge emerge from behind his zipper. She pulls back and looks at him. His face is flushed and he looks nervous. Lilybelle feels her hands grow hot. But just then, Toots appears out of nowhere and decks Lilybelle's date in the face! It's an accident, but her date is really angry and stomps out, leaving Lilybelle without the perfect man all over again.",
