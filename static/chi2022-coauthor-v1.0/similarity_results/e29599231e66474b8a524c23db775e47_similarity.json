He said, \"Thank you for taking care of me.\" The pig smiled. \"No problem dude.\" \n\nAnd then the wolf said, \"Tonight there's going to be a party at my house. The pig's ears perked up. \"Really?\" \n\n\"Yeah, and I want you to come.\" The pig thought about it for a moment. \"I might.\" said the pig. \"Maybe I'll see you there.\" The pig was excited, so he ran back to his house and got ready for the party. A little while after the party started, there was a knock on the door. \n\n\"Who is it?\" There wasn't an answer. The wolf opened the door, and found the pig standing on the porch in an iron lung. \"Hey dude.\" said the pig. The wolf stood there in shock. \"Why are you wearing that?\" \n\n\"Because I live in a uranium house and I don't want to get your friends sick.\" The wolf was touched. \"Well, you look great!\" \n\n\"Thanks.\" And they all had a great night at the party, cancer-free. The wolf and the pig were best friends forever.",
