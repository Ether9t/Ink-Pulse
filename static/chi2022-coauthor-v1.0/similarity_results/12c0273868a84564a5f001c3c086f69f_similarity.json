The wolf thought hard about this because while he was cruel and wanted to destroy the pigs homes', he wanted to do it without harming any of the pigs.\n\nOne day when the little pig was out looking for food the wolf saw a golden opportunity.

The wolf was confused and lit another match and threw it at the home. Again nothing happened. \n\nThe little pig strolled by and walked up to the wolf. He explained that this wasn't typical uranium. It's a special type of uranium that can't be destroyed. The wolf was so angry. He had to go back to the drawing board. \n\nThe little pig had won this battle. He had outsmarted the wolf. He told all of his other pig friends and had them build their homes out of uranium as well. For now, the pigs finally had gotten their revenge on the wolf and there was nothing he could do about it.
