You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" \n\n\"Go away!\" The bee objects. \"But Your Majesty, do you not wish to have your morning breakfast?\" \n\n\"I'm not hungry.\" The queen was certainly not used to being spoken to by anything as lowly as a bee. \n\n\"But Your Majesty, you must eat.\" the bee begged. \"It is your big today.\" \n\n\"What's so big about it?\" The bee twirled about excitedly. \n\n\"You are to be married!\" the bee smiled and flapped its wings. \"Married?! This is untrue!\" The queen was furious. Who would go starting such a ridiculous rumor? \"Your Majesty, it is true! Just look at your hand.\"\n\nThe queen looked at her hand. There, on her finger, was a ring. Astonishing! She had never seen it before. \"Where did this come from? I don't understand. What's going on?\" The bee explained. \"Your wedding day has long been approaching. It's high time you  had yourself a proper husband and king.\" \n\n\"But I don't want a husband. I pride myself on my independence.\" the queen said with her head held high. \"Your Majesty, you will be a good wife and queen. Besides, the family has offered to throw in a private island and a new castle for you and your beloved.\" \n\nThe queen thought for a moment, and finally let out a long sigh. \"Well, I suppose I could do with a husband. Alright, when do I meet him?\" \n\n\"Right now, Your Majesty.\" the bee said and twirled about with a smile. \"Shall we, my dear?\"",
