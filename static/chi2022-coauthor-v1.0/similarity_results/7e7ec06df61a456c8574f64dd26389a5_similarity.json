They set up a meeting in town and nobody really knows what to say. They don't have any information on what actually happened. \n\nThe dads are all very upset and angry. They all go home and turn on the TV. When the TV is turned on there is a message from an alien. He explains that they were doing a science experiment on his home planet. Just switching out one simple word caused all of the dads in town's personalities to change. All over a stupid little mug that they could have thrown in the garbage.\n\nThe dads went from being the upbeat, happy and helpful men to being angry and furious all over the word worst. The alien explains to them that they need to not let words have that kind of power. The entire point of the science project was to teach the humans a lesson. \n\nThe lesson being that overreacting to something small can have bad consequences. The alien tells the dads to think about their wives and children. Did the dads even care about their feelings over this entire ordeal? Of course not. And those people should be the priority in a Dad's life. Not a mug.\n\nThink about that next time a stressful event happens. Always prioritize what's actually important in life. The alien had done his job and the experiment was a success. The dad's had learned from him and were grateful.\n",
