You ask the others why they are all different, but no one has an answer. \n\nA few moments later you see your next life play in front of you, and it is that of a white American man. You continue to watch and see that this person is a successful businessman who has a young wife and stepchild, Harper Campbell. His name is Matty and he works at a bank, JPMorgan. His young wife is named Soeurette. \n\nYou notice that Soeurette's name sounds very familiar, but you brush it off as nothing. You continue watching Matty's life and see how he works hard every day to provide for his family.  You realize that Soeurette is cheating on Matty and then remember where you've heard of her name before. You were her lover, back when you lived in an apartment together. And more astonishingly, you realize that Harper is actually your daughter! This discovery sends you into a state of shock. You are astonished that Soeurette has remarried. She was an excellent lover -- hence the slipup resulting in Harper -- but she was not a good person. You remember that she was unfaithful and malicious. \n\nYou continue to watch Matty's life and see that he eventually finds out that Soeurette is cheating on him. He is deeply hurt, and his soul goes through a process known as \"soul sickness\", where they feel the emotions of their past lives. You feel the pain he feels, and you feel the pain of every other person in the cinema. You become very angry at Soeurette. How dare she cheat on your future self? You realize she has not only been unfaithful to you, but is also likely an unfaithful person generally since she has repeated her bad behavior into the future. \n\nAfter Matty realizes that Soeurette has cheated on him, he takes their stepchild and leaves her. Soeurette is devastated but Matty's drastic actions serve her right. You are glad that she is being punished for her actions. The other people in the cinema are also very angry at her. They are relieved that she has been punished, and they encourage Matty to continue living his life without her. \n\nYou see Matty move on with his life and you can tell he is extremely happy. He meets a woman named Vivian, who is extremely kind. Vivian is nothing like Soeurette. Vivian is the woman that Matty has always deserved. Vivian takes care of Harper like her own. Meanwhile, Soeurette is alone and miserable. She realizes her mistakes and regrets everything.",
