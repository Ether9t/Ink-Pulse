Now, every vehicle in the country belongs to the #1 Dad. But no one knows who the best dad actually is. The country is very concerned about this. \"The One has to be out there somewhere among us. We have to find him.\" \n\nMeanwhile, the #1 Dad is out for a walk. He drives an ordinary unpainted car. No one knows he is the one. Suddenly, he sees a mug sitting on the sidewalk. It has \"#1 Dad\" printed across it. \"Look dad!\" says his son. \"I found that for you.\" The #1 Dad smiles and picks up the mug. \"You are the best dad in the world.\" says the son. \"I love you.\"\n\n\"Thanks, son.\" says the #1 Dad. \"I love you too.\" And that is how an ordinary man became the best dad in the world. Not because his car said so. Because his son said so. ",
