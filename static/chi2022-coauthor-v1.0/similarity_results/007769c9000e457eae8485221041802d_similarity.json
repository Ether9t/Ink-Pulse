        "sentence": "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out. She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. He doesn't realize that he can look like any countless number of people, but that's not what matters. He's never developed a personality. He just shifts to look different constantly so he's never had to develop one. \n\nYet again he only gets so far before she dumps him. This time he goes and asks her what is wrong. She tells him that he just didn't seem very passionate about anything. He only seemed focused on her. He realizes that he loves her enough to start changing not only physically but mentally. \n\nHe begins going to see a psychologist to learn about himself. He also starts taking classes at a local community college. He's learning to try and find out who he is. He's learning that he doesn't need to change his appearance, but he does need to start changing his behavior. Over time he starts to discover that he does have interests. He starts to find out what makes him tick. He likes to cook. He likes horror movies. He appreciates classical music. \n\nAs he discovers these things he spends less time obsessing about her. He's no longer constantly trying to change himself for her. He's wanting to change just to make him happy. He's also not shape shifting any more. He's discovered that is why he is the way he is. He's going to stick with this appearance. \n\nOne day he runs into her at a coffee shop. She notices him from far away. He has a new confidence that draws her to him. She comes over and talks to him.

He's made so much progress and dating her would just send him back to square one. Instead he decides to spend that time at home learning to cook a new recipe. He'll get back to finding love after he masters this recipe. \n",
