And you're right, only an idiot would live in a house built of depleted uranium. I guess I'm just a moron. And actually this is a really cool house.\"\n\nClyde smiled wide. \"I thought you would like it. But now I don't know what to do, I built it so far away from Mom's and she is whining at me to move closer to home. I'm going to have to move.\"\n\nThe wolf nodded, \"Bummer dude. But can you afford 2 houses?\"\n\nThe 92nd little pig sighed and shock his head. \"Nope and that it my problem. I literally can't afford anything because I spent all my money building this house and I'm broke.\"\n\nAll of a sudden the wolf looked excited. \"Hey, I've been meaning to move out of that old cottage in the woods. Maybe I could buy this house from you?\"\n\nClyde tried not to look too eager.",
