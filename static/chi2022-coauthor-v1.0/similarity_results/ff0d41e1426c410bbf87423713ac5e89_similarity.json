She wants to give the two of them another try, but she doesn't want to be deceived again. She tells the man that he is to come of his normal form and they will go on a date. The man agrees, respects her wishes and transforms into himself right in front of her.\n\nThe two go on another date and find they have a lot more in common than they previously had thought. The woman asks the man why he tricked her and he explained that he had confidence issues and didn't think she'd give him the time of day. He told her he was trying to find out what kind of guy she was looking for and found that he wasn't that person. However, the woman agreed to go on a second date with the real man. And a third. And a fourth. They got so close that in the end they got married and had two children. It was a fairytale of sorts with a beautiful ending and one that nobody expected. Not the shapeshifter, nor the woman. Fate is funny sometimes.",
