The entire assassination was staged similar to a movie.\n\nJFK used a stunt double and effects to make it look real. You sit there and tell JFK you want proof. He sends you a picture of his license as well as pictures from his past in his wallet. He also shows you his new license that has a fake name on it as well.\n\nYou sit there shocked and have no idea how to react. JFK tells you that he has a job for you and that you will be paid handsomely. He tells you to pack your bags and that you will be picked up in a few hours.\n\nA few hours later you are picked up and are going to a unknown destination. You sit in the car and the man driving tells you that you will be working with JFK. You ask him what the job is and he tells you that you will be working with JFK to help him take down the Illuminati.\n\nYou ask JFK what the issue with the Illuminati is. He tells you that they are a group of people who control the world and have been doing so for centuries. They are a group of people who control the world's money supply and are very rich. \n\nHe tells you that he wants to take them down and that he needs your help. You tell JFK that you would love to help but don't know where to start. JFK tells you that he has a plan and that he will explain it to you on the way. He explains that you that he is going to infiltrate the Illumanti and destroy them from the inside. His new alias is the 3rd richest person in the world.\n\nYou are shocked at this information as well and get uncomfortable. You tell JFK that you're too afraid to help and want to go back to your wife and children. JFK gets very upset and tells you that you clearly don't care about your country. You go back home and are confident that you made the right decision. While you value your country, there is too many things that could go wrong and harm you or your family. You made the right call.",
