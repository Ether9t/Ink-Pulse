She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. It has been hard for the shapeshifter to get it right. He's not used to being rejected. The woman is a good woman and she is not interested in a relationship with a man who's always changing into a different man.\nThe man does not know what to do. He cannot change himself. He will always be a shapeshifter. Then he has an idea. He cannot stop being a shapeshifter but he can change the woman into one. He just has to figure out how to do this without her being upset with him.\nThe man has a good friend who is a witch. He goes to her for advice. She tells him that he can change the woman into a shapeshifter just like him. It will be easy to do. He just needs a special tea the witch can give him. He asks the witch if it is a good thing to do. She tells him it is a good thing to do. She says anyone would be happy with the gift of a special power. \nThe man goes home and makes the tea. He takes it to the woman but on the way he spills a bit on the floor. A cat comes by and drinks the tea. The man sits with the woman while she drinks her tea and he wonders how she is feeling. He is excited and nervous. He hopes he is not punished by the universe for casting this spell on the woman he loves.",
