She says she is at your aid and she will dispense any member of her hive to aid you too. \"But how did I get picked for this role?\" you ask, incredulously. The queen explains that the Almighty King of the Bees has been watching you for a while, and he sees your potential to be a great leader. You are skeptical. \"I'm just an ordinary person,\" you tell the queen. She laughs and says \"Yes, but the Almighty King of the Bees sees great things ahead for you.\" She tells you that it is an honor to have been called by the Almighty King of the Bees to serve as a human leader of all bees.  You just can't understand how you were tapped for this role but then Michael explains. \"Do you remember the time you had that peanut butter and honey sandwich?\" he asks. \"Well, the Almighty King of the Bees was watching and saw you happily enjoying your sandwich. He knows you like honey and was moved by your love of it. So he decided that you would be a perfect human leader of the bees.\" You are surprised that eating such a simple thing as a peanut butter and honey sandwich would land you such a title and role in the world, but it doesn't seem like you can argue more. You have been chosen. Michael says to you \"Remember, we are here to serve you.\" You nod and then send the bees on their first task. You tell the bees to go far away and to not come back. The bees are obligated to listen to your commands and do so. Within minutes, they are gone. When you turn to Michael, he disappears as well. You are all alone. Later that day at lunch, you look at the sandwich on your table and think about how it changed your life. But you are glad to be rid of the bees, for that role seemed like it would be too much responsibility and moreover, you really didn't want a swarm of pesky bees in your ear all day.",
