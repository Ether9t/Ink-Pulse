Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nI am very surprised to hear a bee talk, but nevertheless I asked the bee \"What do you mean?\"\nThe bee replied \"You are the queen of the bees and the bees have chosen you to rule over them.\"\nI thought this was strange since I'm deathly allergic to bee but I was happy to be queen so I played along.\nThe bee then said \"Your first order is to go to the meadow and make a hive.\" I didn't know how to make a hive the way bees do, but I did the best I could. I got some sticks and leaves and I made a hive that looked just like a little house for the bees. \"How's that?\" I asked the bee when I was finished.\nI heard the bee say \"It's very nice, but you forgot the most important thing.\" \n\"And what's that?\" I asked. And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. \"There, it's safe now,\" I said to the bee.\nThe next day, I could see hundreds of bees moving into the hive. \"They won't sting me will they?\" I asked my new friend. \n\"No, you are the queen and they will do anything for you,\" the bee replied. And then I had a great idea. \n\"Little bee I have a favor to ask of you,\" I told my friend. \n\"What is that?\" asked the friendly bee.\n\"I am so allergic to a bee sting. I am willing to be your queen and I will even stay and guard the hive if you do me this one thing. Can you make me not allergic to bee stings?\"",

So a great deal was worked out. I kept the bees safe from harm and I was protected from being stung by bees again for the rest of my life. The end.",
