It was another \"Lost Generation\" member! I could tell by the gray hair on her head. She welcomed us inside. \"You're home,\" she told us as we sat down in the lobby chairs with here. We were each given a new immortality drug that the young didn't know about. It turns out we landed in a town filled with the \"lost\" who had all escaped like we did. With this drug created by one of the Lost we were also able to live forever. Not as young people, but just as we were. And this is where it ends. We are safe here now in this community. The young greedy ones stay on their side and we ours. And we like it that way.",
