As he was about to head to the shower he noticed that his other mug that his wife bought him shortly after their daughter was born said \"#5467 Dad\". He was dumbfounded. \"They really went all in on this prank\" Jeff thought to himself as he jumped in the shower. \n\nHe got dressed and headed off to work.\n\nAs he drove to work, he noticed a lot of people out and about in his neighborhood yelling at each other in various stages of dress. Some men in bathrobes other wearing nothing but boxer shorts and sandals all showing each other their coffee mugs. Jeff rolled down his windows to ask what was going on. Mr, Jennings, Jeff's neighbor strolled over to the window and leaned in and said \"Finkel here says he is a better dad than me and he can prove it! So he whips out this coffee mug that says \"#8243 Dad\" on it. I laughed at him and went in to get my mug that my kids got me for Christmas that said \"#1 Dad\" on it but I could only find this one that said \"#12845 Dad\" on it\" tears were welling up in his eyes.\n\"Oh well, I'm sure you'll find the other one soon.\" Jeff said as he sped off down the road.\n\nAs he pulled into the parking lot of his office building he noticed that all of the cars had their windows down and coffee mugs out. Everyone was comparing how \"Dadly\" they were. Phil from accounting was strutting around with a mug that ranked him as the 433rd best dad, but Mark the new guy in the mailroom showed him his \"#102 Dad\" mug. Phil threw his mug in the trash. Jeff thought to himself that the prank was getting a little out of hand.\n\nHe entered the office and as he walked down the hall, he noticed that all of the doors were open and people where shouting about who was the better dad. Then all of the sudden Sally from the warehouse came screaming down the hall saying they found the real \"#1 Dad\" in Rome, it ended up being the Pope.  Everyone was stunned to see the Pope was a dad.",
