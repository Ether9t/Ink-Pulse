Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. The side effects are quite devastating, and you suddenly realize at the ripe old age of 85 how lucky you are to have escaped them entirely. However, some of the people that you love aren't quite so lucky. For example, your wife, Soeurette, is several years younger than you. She did receive the drug. She isn't aging, but the drug has its consequences. And they are manifesting now, all these years later. Will you be able to help her? \n\nYou frankly don't trust that you will be able to help her. All your life you've done nothing but protect her from harm's way but now you don't think you will be able to. You don't think you can protect her from herself or the heinous results of a flawed experiment. Soeurette's blonde hair has all fallen out. Her fingers and toes have all distorted into claw-like appendages. And perhaps worst of all, she's lost all sense of sanity. Her mind is actually going crazy and you are watching her rapid snowball decline from reality. \n\nAnd the worse part is, it's happening right before your eyes. Your heart aches for the woman that you love and suddenly you realize what you need to do. You need to do whatever it takes to stop the people that did this to her and other innocent victims. You immediately identify the pharmaceutical company that created this drug so many years ago. It was called Biogenetic Research. You vow to hold them responsible for their negligence. You will be the one to make them pay. And you have decided to do so by filing a class action lawsuit. ",

You are absolutely happy that justice was served in this incident, although Soeurette's death puts a damper on how you are feeling and makes you feel guilty all over again for having allowed this all to happen to her. However, you know you are taking baby steps toward rectifying this situation for Soeurette. So you will count this experience of going to court on her behalf as a total win and will not let anyone else tell you otherwise. ",
