He gently stroked the side of her face and told her how special she was. After a tender kiss he leaned back and looked at her intently.\n\nThen he told her it was that special quality that made him unable to give up on her. At first she was confused.  But then he explained to her that all of the men had been him. Every good part of the previous men were still there. But with each time he failed with her, he learned what he had done wrong and kept trying. And now finally he was literally her perfect man, because he had spent years learning from his failure to be just that. It was overwhelming for her and she knew that it would take awhile to sink in. But for now, she was content to relax herself in his arms, marveling over how one person could have possibly loved her that much. And in the circle of his arms she knew without a doubt that she had found the one.",
