You look at the bee and say, \"I don't understand.\" The bee says, \"We are your personal hive and we are at your service for whatever you need.\" Finally, you start to get an idea for how the bees can be useful to you. You say, \"You know what, I have the perfect order for you.\" The bees all buzz in excitement. I say, \"Go to a girl named Soeurette's apartment and cover her in stings. Soeurette has always been rude to me and I would like to use this opportunity for payback!\" The bees fly off your hand and head towards Soeurette's apartment. You watch them go, and you're filled with a sense of power. You've never had the ability to control anything before, but now you can control the bees. You can control the bees! And now, you can also control Soeurette. You can make her pay for all the times she's been rude to you. The bees get to Soeurette's apartment. They fly in through her window and start stinging her. She screams and tries to swat them away, but there are too many of them. She runs around her apartment, trying to escape them, but they keep coming. She falls to the ground, and the bees continue to sting her. She looks up at you and says, \"Why are you doing this to me? I've never done anything to you!\" You smile and say, \"You've been rude to me for years. I've never been able to get back at you, but now I can. This is my revenge.\" Soeurette is shocked to know that you are king of the bees and that they are all at your service at the drop of a hat. She apologizes profusely to you and says she will never be rude to you again. And from that moment on, she is always very polite.",
