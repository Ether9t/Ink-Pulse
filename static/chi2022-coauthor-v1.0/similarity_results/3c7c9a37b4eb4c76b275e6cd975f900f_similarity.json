Not everyone could be the best dad in the world but everyone could get the #1 dad cup. I think my dad is the best dad in the world and he could get that number 1, best in the world title.

The company must be selling a lot of those mugs because they have to come up with more and more of them as the Dads out there buy the mugs so they can call themselves the \"#1 Dad\". I don't think it sells as much as the \"World's Greatest Dad\" mug, but i'm sure it sells well. Actually any dad mugs are good sellers, if not the the season dads just buy it to boost their identity as a false sense of actually being a great dad. A mug does not make someone a great dad automatically , you actually have to be a great dad. But hey we will just call you the best dad in the world because of a mug. So if you are the best Dad out there, make sure you show off that #1 dad mug this fathers day. I know my dad would be proud to have a number 1 dad mug, so will you. :-) When that time of year comes people will no matter what buy those mugs and it will boost the companies sales , it is guaranteed that millions of these will sell each fathers day. It is a symbol of pride for dads out there to have the #1 Dad mug.",
