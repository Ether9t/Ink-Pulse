        "sentence": "When you're 28, science discovers a drug that stops all effects of aging, creating immortality. Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the \"Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. Now, it's too late. It is rumored that a new drug has been created. But the government isn't giving it away for free. It is too expensive for most citizens so people are going great lengths to obtain it illegally. \n\nTo get the drug, you and your friends decide to find a way into the headquarters of the government facility where it is supposedly being held. The risks are high, but the group is going for it anyway. They planned carefully and the big night had finally arrived. They began their journey and successfully make it into the facility. They follow the map to the vault where the drugs are being stored. But it turns out there is an alarm. They hadn't planned for this. They had to either turn around and leave now, or find a way to bypass the alarm. They chose to continue and discover an elevator that leads to a secret floor deep within the building. The elevator descended to the floor below, and then kept going and going. It was not to the lower floor, but to another section of the facility. It went down so far they couldn't fathom how far underground they had gone. Then, the elevator stopped and the doors opened. They were in a strange laboratory. \"This must be where they make the drug.\" you thought. The team searched on. \"We shouldn't be down here. We should just find the product and go. We shouldn't mess with this stuff.\" your best friend said. Suddenly, the elevator doors closed and the elevator lifted up away, leaving them in the deep basement. They were stuck. They went to press the elevator buttons, but there weren't any. A few moments later, the doors opened and a mysterious figure walked in. He was the leader of the facility. \"I understand you want access to our product. I have a better offer.\" he said. \"I will give you access, but you must agree to my terms.\" They agreed. ",
