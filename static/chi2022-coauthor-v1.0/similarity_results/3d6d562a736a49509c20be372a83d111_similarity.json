She told Riku she was his grandmother, and when his parent were killed by magic hunters, she and her husband had each taken one of the children and fled to keep them safe and keep teaching them magic.  Selphie was his sister!  By this point, she had joined them in the parlor and they both listed to the story their grandmother told.  She was teaching Selphie magic, but neither Riku nor Selphie's magic would be strong until they were reunited, as they were twins.  She hadn't known that her husband had passed away.

She told Riku she was his grandmother, and when his parent were killed by magic hunters, she and her husband had each taken one of the children and fled to keep them safe and keep teaching them magic.  Selphie was his sister!  By this point, she had joined them in the parlor and they both listed to the story their grandmother told.  She was teaching Selphie magic, but neither Riku nor Selphie's magic would be strong until they were reunited, as they were twins.  She hadn't known that her husband had passed away.  They hadn't seen each other in nearly 12 years, but had kept in touch as best they could.  ",

Selphie lived with her grandmother. He arrived with some flowers he had picked.  When he knocked on the door, an elderly woman opened it.  Riku stood in the doorway, frozen solid.  It was an older version of the woman in the photograph that his grandfather had.  Riku knew it had to be her; he too had spent hours looking at that photograph.  The woman also stood very still, staring at him.\n\n\"Riku,\" she said.  \"Is it you?\"\n\n\"Have we met?\" Riku asked?\n\n\"Have you come here from Landro?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Riku said.\n\n\"Is Frezna your grandfather,\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Riku responded.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He died, and I came to Faltra to find someone to continue my magic education.\"\n\nThe woman motioned him inside, and sat heavily on the sofa, tears running down her face.  She told Riku she was his grandmother, and when his parent were killed by magic hunters, she and her husband had each taken one of the children and fled to keep them safe and keep teaching them magic.  Selphie was his sister!  By this point, she had joined them in the parlor and they both listed to the story their grandmother told.  She was teaching Selphie magic, but neither Riku nor Selphie's magic would be strong until they were reunited, as they were twins.  She hadn't known that her husband had passed away.  They hadn't seen each other in nearly 12 years, but had kept in touch as best they could.  ",
