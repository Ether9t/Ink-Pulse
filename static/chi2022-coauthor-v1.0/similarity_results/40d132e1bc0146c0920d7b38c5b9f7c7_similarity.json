He had muscles and chiseled features and really should be hard to resist. But she just wasn't interested. He realized that yet again as he tried to move forward with their relationship. He just couldn't get her to love him. He decided to try something drastic that was a hail Mary move basically. He shape shifted to look exactly like her. People like themselves, right? She can't not like herself. \n\nHe was right. When she saw herself she was beyond intrigued. She apparently had an interest in doppelgangers that he was not aware of. She was so into herself that she couldn't resist. She just wanted to spend time with her doppelganger. He knew enough about her to be able to pretend to be her flawlessly. \n\nNothing romantic came of it. He was just happy to be with her. It was a way to do that even if it wasn't at all what he had hoped for. He would shape shift into her and basically just hang out around her apartment while pretending to be her. It was quite the unusual love story. \n\nEventually she asked him to move in with her. He of course agreed. Now he was living with her, and they were spending all of their time together. He no longer had an identity of his own, even if they were just ones he had created while shape shifting. Now he was her all of the time. He was her boyfriend, at least in his head. In reality he was just a fascination for her. You can't always pick how you will be loved but you must accept it. ",
