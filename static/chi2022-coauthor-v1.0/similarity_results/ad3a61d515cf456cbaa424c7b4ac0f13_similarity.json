        "sentence": "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing. The alien's name is Soeurette and she is determined to marry Matt no matter what, because she has fallen in love with him. She has kidnapped Matt and taken him to her home planet, and has been trying to convince him to marry her. Matt is totally uninterested in Soeurette's advances and keeps telling her to let him go, but Soeurette is delusional and thinks that Matt is in love with her and is just playing hard to get. \n\nSoeurette is a very determined alien, and she is not going to give up on her love for Matt. She has been trying to convince Matt to marry her for a long time, and she is not going to give up on him that easily. She finally decides to tell him that she is pregnant to force Matt's hand at marriage. Matt is shocked by this, but he is even more shocked when he finds out that Soeurette is actually pregnant -- since she could have been lying. He is even more shocked when he finds out that he is the father of the child. \n\nMatt is not ready to be a father, and he is not ready to be married. He has no idea how he could be the father of this child, since he has never slept with Soeurette. In fact, he has never even kissed her. So how could he possibly be the father of her child? It doesn't make sense. In fact, Matt is convinced that Soeurette is lying to him. This is when Matt decides to deploy forces from planet Earth to help save him. He knows that people on Earth have been looking for him relentlessly; they just don't know which planet he is on now. Matt sends a radio signal to planet Earth to let everyone know that he needs to be rescued immediately from Soeurette's planet, which is named \"Zorba\". Immediately, human forces are mobilized and a rescue platoon is sent into space to bring Matt back to Earth. Soeurette, of course, is not going to let Matt go without a fight. She is determined to keep Matt on her planet, and she is determined to keep him as her husband. In fact, she has already started wedding planning and has already booked a cake tasting, a caterer, a wedding menu designer, a dress tailor, and a wedding photographer.\n\nMatt is feeling increasingly annoyed by Soeurette, since she is not taking no for an answer. He also knows he cannot possibly have gotten Soeurette pregnant, since he has never slept with her. When the platoon arrives on planet Zorba, Matt immediately hops in with the rescue team. Soeurette pleads with him to stay, but Matt is determined to get back to Earth. He has no desire to stay on Zorba with Soeurette, who he deems to be truly crazy and in need of psychological help and therapy. As a result, Matt gets back to planet Earth and is happy to be rid of Soeurette. Meanwhile, Soeurette is heartbroken and feels like Matt has abandoned her. She has no idea who the father of her baby is because she has been with quite a few guys at this point, and she has no idea which one of them is the father of her baby. So, while Matt is able to move on with his life, Soeurette is not and she ends up dying poor and lonely, all as consequence for her behavior. ",
