The alien's name is Soeurette and she is determined to marry Matt no matter what, because she has fallen in love with him. She has kidnapped Matt and taken him to her home planet, and has been trying to convince him to marry her.

Matt sends a radio signal to planet Earth to let everyone know that he needs to be rescued immediately from Soeurette's planet, which is named \"Zorba\". Immediately, human forces are mobilized and a rescue platoon is sent into space to bring Matt back to Earth. Soeurette, of course, is not going to let Matt go without a fight. She is determined to keep Matt on her planet, and she is determined to keep him as her husband. In fact, she has already started wedding planning and has already booked a cake tasting, a caterer, a wedding menu designer, a dress tailor, and a wedding photographer.\n\nMatt is feeling increasingly annoyed by Soeurette, since she is not taking no for an answer.
