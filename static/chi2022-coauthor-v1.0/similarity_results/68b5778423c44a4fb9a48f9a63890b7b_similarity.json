You could watch their grandchildren grow up, for that matter. Barring any accidents or new diseases, that science hasn't learned how to treat effectively, you could basically live forever. But, you've already seen your grandchildren grow up. They are already taking the anti-aging drug. You just can't know if it's worth doing it all, over again, from the point of view of a tired, 85 year old man.\n\nThis is the central question of the story. How much life is too much living? How much is enough? You can ponder this question until the end of time, taking the drug to buy more days of contemplation. Or, you can simply die. You can die, knowing that you've lived a full life. Only one life, but that was the deal. You took the deal.\n\nYou don't want to extend your life, only out of fear. You don't want to end it out of fear either. You want this decision to be based on what has happened and what could still happen, from a hopeful perspective. You just can't know if it's realistic to look forward to a bright future. It's all a gamble, and you just don't know if you want to ante up again. It's a very difficult decision. \n\nThe story is told from the perspective of a man named John, who is 85. In the end, he decided to let go and allow himself to die. We will never know if that was the right choice.",
