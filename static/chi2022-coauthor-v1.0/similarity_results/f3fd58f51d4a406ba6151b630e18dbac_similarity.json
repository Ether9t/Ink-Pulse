I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love. My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love. My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love. My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love. My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love. My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love. My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love. My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",

My father was a strong, gentle man, who had always sacrificed so much with my mother, to make sure we had everything we needed growing up. I woke up early that morning because I was so excited that I could not sleep. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents. I heard my father get up to have his breakfast in the kitchen like he usually did every morning. I ran into the kitchen and said \"Happy Father's Day dad\", and gave him a hug. I then handed him the mug and told him that I loved him. It was always easy to please my father, he was a man with simple taste. My father looked at the mug with a giant smile and hugged me once more. \"I love it\", he said to me and poured himself some hot coffee in his new mug. I sat down at the table with him to have breakfast. We had cereal together and when my mother got up to have breakfast, she made pancakes. We all sat down together at the table to celebrate my father. Suddenly, my father's expression changed into one of happiness to confusion. I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\". I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\". The mug now said \"#25th Dad\". My father asked if it was some cruel joke. How could the mug just change on its own? Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.  ",
