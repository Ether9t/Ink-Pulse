She says due to deforestation and climate change the bees are struggling and I need to help so that their population can be saved. She says that I need to take volunteer bees and go around and start new populations across the continent. My reward would be all the honey I can take to sell to fund this expedition. I agree to fulfill the mission.\n\nThe next few months I go around the US. Leaving groups of bees where I see fit so that they may flourish. I take the honey to sell to fund the trip. City to city, state to state, coast to coast I go. I finish the mission and go back to the queen. She tells me the mission is a success. She allows me more honey and I become a very successful beekeeper and are allowed to live out my life with the Beekeeper's Gift. ",
