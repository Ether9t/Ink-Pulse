When you're 29, the side effects are finally discovered.\n\nThe drug seems to be working. People don't die from anything. No disease. Nothing physical. Not even aging. Humans can survive everything. But there's a catch. People are going insane. The drug has created a new mental disorder, called \"The Madness\". People are a lot more aggressive. People are a lot more mean. They lack empathy.

They have decided to put the drug is a sort of \"bomb\" and \"bomb\" the cities. Not explosives but as a way of spreading the drug and force people to take it. They will also use planes with the drug and spray the air and let people inhale the drug.\n\nAnd I so happen to be a military pilot. My mission is to help distribute the drug to major cities. I have been given a plane and a crew. I have been given a list of cities to bomb. I have 72 hours to hit as many cities as possible. I get on my mission and it is a success. All around the country people are losing The Madness. ",
