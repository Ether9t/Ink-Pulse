For example, the way zero-price markets might advertise their goods could be in a way that works against their consumers. Take a game company who used ads to get revenue in a video game. Since the company wants money, they won't really care what ads they use and could harm young consumers by signing with a disgusting type of ad. TAdditionally,ets might also prioritize profit over user experiences, leading to decreased product satisfaction  for consumers.Establishing antitrust laws may significantly reduce these side-effects and may bring to light those zero-price markets that rely on corrupted regulation. So, though zero-price markets may seem effectively different from other types of markets, they may still need significant regulations since antitrust laws don't only rely on money, but also involve significant market competition regulation and maintaining fair practices.\n",
