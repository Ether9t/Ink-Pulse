Regardless of the decided solution the legislators proceed with it is clear that these markets require a level of regulation similar to other markets. The idea that  consumer welfare is maintained through them notdirectly paying is disingenuous to the actual problem these markets face.  The alternative revenue streams that instead pay these companies do so for the purpose of gettignnthe users data or selling them a product through advertising them things. So instead of the users paying for a product they are instead being sold as the prodc to other companies. This is not a reason to think that these zero-market companies then should be free of anti trust regulation but should instead get a similar or greater level of regulation to account for this.
