Antitrust laws were put in place to keep prices fair and prevent companies from exploiting customers through unfair practices. However, these laws often struggle with new markets, especially those offering services for free, like many tech companies today. Markets of free goods and services, called zero-price markets, have raised many questions about how we should approach and apply antitrust regulation laws and policies. These zero-price markets have increased in variety and number, with examples such as social media, travel booking, or software. Big tech companies like Google often dominate zero-price markets, leading to worries about unfair practices and stifled competition. For example, Google faced lawsuits for allegedly monopolizing search engines, limiting competition and harming users.
