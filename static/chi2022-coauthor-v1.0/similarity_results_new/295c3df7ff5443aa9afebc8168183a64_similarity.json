There are solutions to how they could account for the impact without using money as the metric but if they would liekkto stay consistent with the scale they could accoutnnfooother revenue streams from third parties as a way to see how the market is being impacted bytuthese zero price markets. Regardless of the decided solution the legislators proceed with it is clear that these markets require a level of regulation similar to other markets. The idea that  consumer welfare is maintained through them notdirectly paying is disingenuous to the actual problem these markets face.  The alternative revenue streams that instead pay these companies do so for the purpose of gettignnthe users data or selling them a product through advertising them things. So instead of the users paying for a product they are instead being sold as the prodc to other companies. This is not a reason to think that these zero-market companies then should be free of anti trust regulation but should instead get a similar or greater level of regulation to account for this. The market and the consumer would both benefit from creatignnnew laws to accoutnnfor these zero-cost markets that would otherwise be left unchecked by these laws",
