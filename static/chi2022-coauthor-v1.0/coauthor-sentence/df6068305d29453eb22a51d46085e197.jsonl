    "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing.",
    "The alien spent years trying to understand human culture to determine who would be most suited to probing and interrogation to learn more about Earth, and unfortunately their primary source for knowledge were Hollywood films.",
    "Their most recent film being The Martian, they thought Matt Damon with his experience on Mars would be the perfect fit.",
    "The alien is a bit confused by the fact that the humans are not sending a rescue mission, but are instead sending a single individual.",
    "This was not just any individual though, this was Dennis Rodman, the man who was able to soften the heart of North Korea's dictator.",
    "If humanity thought anyone would be able to get the alien to understand we needed our Hollywood star back, it would be him.",
    "As Dennis arrived at the spot Matt Damon was originally kidnapped, he found something very strange.",
    "The alien had not only kidnapped Matt Damon, but also the rest of the crew from The Martian.",
    "It seemed that this alien wasn't just studying Earth's culture, it was searching Earth for a way to colonize Mars for it's own alien race.",
    "Humanity was lucky these aliens were considerate enough to not want to invade and share Earth, they were just looking for a way to somehow live on a brand new and empty planet!",
    "Dennis Rodman was able to convince the alien to send all the humans back to Earth, and to give him a chance to convince them that humanity had not yet figured out a way to colonize new planets.",
    "In fact, this was part of the reason the movie The Martian exists: because humanity is still longing and dreaming up ways to learn how it would be possible to live on other planets and so we try to imagine ways to do it in fictions.",
    "Unsatisfied, but understanding, the alien released the entire cast of The Martian and went back to their home planet to give the bad news to it's people.",
    "Luckily, it did not do so empty handed though, as it had kept a copy of The Martian to reinvigorate their alien scientists back home.",
    "The End.",
