Maybe there is something to this so-called conspiracy of the Bees dying. Your sister of all people backed up the Bee's fear, with viable scientific evidence.\n\nYou tell Mr Bee that you will have a plan to save the bees by the end of the week. That is when the Bee can really be valuable. The Bee will carry out your orders to keep the earth friendly and viable for all living beings.\n\n",
