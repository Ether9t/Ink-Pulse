    "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.",
    "I pulled my coffee mug out of the cabinet one morning and a peculiar thing happened.",
    "The mug, which had always read \"#1 Dad\" suddenly changed to \"#4 Dad.\" I didn't understand why this was happening so I decided to call my dad.",
    "\"Dad, I just pulled out my #1 Dad mug and it changed to #4 Dad.\" I told him.",
    "And he said, \"Oh, I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted.\" I didn't understand.",
    "But he told me about a news story he saw last night.",
    "Apparently all of the #1 Dad mugs in the world have been randomly changing ranking to reflect the actual ranking of dads.",
    "So now I'm #4 Dad.",
    "I figured #4 is still really good so I wasn't too worried about it.",
    "The next day I pulled out my mug and it had changed to \"#5 Dad.\" I wondered why it had gone down.",
    "I called my dad and he said, \"I'm sorry, son, but I guess you've been demoted again.\" So I decided that that week, I would be the best dad I could, in effort to make the ranking go back up to #1.",
    "I played with my kids, I took them to the park, I helped them with their homework, I even went to the grocery store with my wife and helped pick out their favorite meals.",
    "My two kids and my wife were both very appreciative.",
    "The next morning I pulled out my mug and it had changed to \"#3 Dad.\" I was so happy that my ranking had gone back up again.",
    "I decided that I would continue my added efforts in being a good dad.",
    "I wondered if I would ever get back to #1.",
    "I also wondered why the mugs did that in the first place.",
    "In the end though, mystery unsolved, I decided that I enjoyed being a better dad.",
    "Ranking or not, I continued that way from then on and we were all a happy family from that day forth.",
