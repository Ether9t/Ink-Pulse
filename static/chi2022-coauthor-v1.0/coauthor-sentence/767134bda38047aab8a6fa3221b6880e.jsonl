    "Humans once wielded formidable magical power.",
    "But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect.",
    "When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.",
    "This power gives them the ability to have a collective mind.",
    "This new collective mind, called the Consciousness, is a remarkable phenomenon.",
    "But it is also a weapon that can give humanity the edge it needs to drive back the Ethereal invaders.",
    "It allows them to plan across the world without even having to communicate.",
    "They begin working on a plan.",
    "Using the Consciousness as a weapon, they begin to fight back against those who would see them destroyed.",
    "They come up with a timed attack.",
    "They strike at the same times in every location and hit the Ethereals where they least expect it.",
    "This is successful.",
    "It catches them off guard.",
    "But it does not finish them off.",
    "They then have to focus their attacks more.",
    "People have to travel to join larger groups to take down the largest of the aliens.",
    "They have to work together to survive.",
    "They need to work together to end this.",
    "It takes some time but they finally take down the larger aliens and free the earth from this invasion.",
    "But it is not without great cost.",
    "Humans are a much smaller population now.",
    "Many people like this new power that they share.",
    "A movement starts that wants to ban people from having children because it would lesson their power.",
    "Without children in the future, the Consciousness would be even stronger.",
    "This splits the world into two groups, those who want to repopulate and those who do not.",
    "These two sides go to war.",
    "It causes even more death.",
    "The people who do not want to repopulate get the advantage.",
    "They then end up wiping out the other group.",
    "The survivors then begin killing each other, thinking that they may gain new powers if there are less people.",
    "This continues until there is one human left, who realizes there were no extra powers.",
    "They have the ultimate collective mind to share with no one else.",
