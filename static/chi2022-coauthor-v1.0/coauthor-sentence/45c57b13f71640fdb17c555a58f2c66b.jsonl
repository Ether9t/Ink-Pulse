    "Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them.",
    "So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.",
    "You know the story about the first three little pigs.",
    "This is a story about the 92nd little pig.",
    "The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium.",
    "And the wolf was like, \"dude.\"\nWith a surprised look on the wolf's face , the 92nd little pig said, \"Not so fast, wolf.",
    "I know who you are.\" said the 92nd pig \"I know you are the wolf, and I know you are not to be trusted.\"\n\n\"You do, do you?\" said the wolf \"Then who am I?\".",
    "The 92nd pig said \"You are the wolf who ate my brothers and sisters when we where just trying to find our why in life, and mind our own business.\" The wolf looked at him and said   \"You are right.",
    "Then you know why I am here.\" \"Yes, I do.\" said the 92nd pig.",
    "\"You are here to eat me, and I am here to stop you.\" \n\nThat got a huge laugh out of the wolf \"How are you going to stop me then, before I huff and puff and blow your house in?\" \"I don't have to stop you\" said the 92nd pig.",
    "\"I just have to make you so sick that you will not be able to blow my house in.",
    "As you can see, my house is made of uranium, and it is poisoning you right now as we speak.\" \"No it's not\" said the wolf.",
    "The pig ran inside and locked the door.",
    "Then the wolf said \"Oh little pig, little pig.\" Then started to huff and puff, then he huffed and puffed more.",
    "He just couldn't blow the house in.",
    "As a matter of fact, he started to feel really tired, and saw his hair started to fall out.",
    "\"What's going on here?\" said the wolf, just as he collapsed and fell over dead.",
    "The 92nd pig had gotten his revenge finally.",
