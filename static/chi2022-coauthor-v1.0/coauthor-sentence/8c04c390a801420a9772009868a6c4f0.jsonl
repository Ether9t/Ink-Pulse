But this time, even after weeks of being nice and approaching her in all the right ways, she wouldn't even accept a date with her.\n\n\"Kara, why won't you go out with me,\" he cajoled. \"We'd be so perfect together!\" \n\nKara looked at him from across the table in the coffee shop they were in. \"Chris, it's just...I don't know. I feel like I know you so well, and we share so many things, but it also feels completely wrong. I can't even imagine dating you.\" She looked away, with an awkward expression. \"I'm sorry, but if you are  going to keep pushing, I don't think we should be friends.\"\n\nHe stood up in a rage, finally losing all of his cool and caution. \"What do you mean by that. After all of these years and all of the work I've done to be perfect and you won't even listen to me!\"\n\nKara was certain he was having a breakdown. Maybe that was why all of her internal warnings not to date him had been going off? \"Chris, calm down. I said I feel like I've known you forever, but it has only been a few weeks.,,\"\n\nSuddenly, as she looked at him, his face and body morphed. From one familiar form to another, until finally he became the man she had met years ago. The man she still loved, but wasn't sure he could trust. And now she knew why.\n\nShe stood up, and ran away. As he ran after her, he tripped and fell into the street. By the time he got up and out of the way of traffic she was gone. And, as his rage faded he knew that this time he needed to let her go. He thought of the terror and betrayal he had seen in her eyes the moment before she ran. It finally broke his heart. He changed shape and walked away again. And this time he just kept walking.",
