She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.\n\nOne day, a man looked at himself in the mirror. “I’m not the man I want to be. And I can't seem to keep the woman I love. What am I going to do?”\n\nThe thing was, he had a pretty good idea of what he needed to do, he just wasn't sure it was the right thing to do.\n\nThe man was a shapeshifter. And over the years he had used his abilities to change his identity several times - whenever he missed out on a big job because of a bad interview, when he had gotten in trouble with the law, and yes, even with women. But when he had met Kara he decided he needed to change. She was the first person who had given him confidence in a long time. And he was certain he wanted to be with her forever. But after a little while, she started to notice things about him that he had wanted to hide. And she seemed to pull away from him. And last night, she broke up with him and said she didn't want to see him any more, that he wasn't the man she thought he was when they met.\n\nHe didn't need to be a mind reader to know what was going on. She was right, he wasn't the man she thought he was. So now the choice, did he change his face and try to be the man she wanted, or just let her go.\n\nHe looked at himself in the mirror again, and he made his decision. Not that it was ever really in question. And his eyes changed color, he grew and inch, and dozens of other changes happened. And then he started planning.\n\nThe first time they met again was at the library. She was looking for a book, and he was looking for her. And they chatted, and hit it off, just like the last time. And again they started dating. And he told her about his plans for the future, and she listened, and seemed to like what he had in mind. But again, after about 6 months, she broke up with him, with the same \"You're not the man I thought you were.\"\n\nThe next time, he went for a little less attractive, a little more cuddly. And it was at the supermarket they met. He really thought he had it that time, but after only a few months she started saying they should see other people. \n\n",

And it was at the supermarket they met. He really thought he had it that time, but after only a few months she started saying they should see other people. \n\nHe was getting frustrated. And even angry at her. One more time - the most attractive form he had ever taken, with all of the right words and gifts and thoughtfulness. But this time, even after weeks of being nice and approaching her in all the right ways, she wouldn't even accept a date with her.\n\n\"Kara, why won't you go out with me,\" he cajoled. \"We'd be so perfect together!\" \n\nKara looked at him from across the table in the coffee shop they were in. \"Chris, it's just...I don't know. I feel like I know you so well, and we share so many things, but it also feels completely wrong. I can't even imagine dating you.\" She looked away, with an awkward expression. \"I'm sorry, but if you are  going to keep pushing, I don't think we should be friends.\"\n\nHe stood up in a rage, finally losing all of his cool and caution. \"What do you mean by that. After all of these years and all of the work I've done to be perfect and you won't even listen to me!\"\n\nKara was certain he was having a breakdown. Maybe that was why all of her internal warnings not to date him had been going off? \"Chris, calm down. I said I feel like I've known you forever, but it has only been a few weeks.,,\"\n\nSuddenly, as she looked at him, his face and body morphed. From one familiar form to another, until finally he became the man she had met years ago. The man she still loved, but wasn't sure he could trust. And now she knew why.\n\nShe stood up, and ran away. As he ran after her, he tripped and fell into the street. By the time he got up and out of the way of traffic she was gone. And, as his rage faded he knew that this time he needed to let her go. He thought of the terror and betrayal he had seen in her eyes the moment before she ran. It finally broke his heart. He changed shape and walked away again. And this time he just kept walking.",
