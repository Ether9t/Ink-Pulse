    "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you.",
    "You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.",
    "You find out that you are all competing to see which of you will get to live the new life.",
    "The winner gets to live as a human, while the rest will be reincarnated as animals.",
    "This instantly motivates everyone.",
    "They begin going through different rounds of games as different people are eliminated.",
    "I make it pretty far, past a trivia round and a physical endurance challenge.",
    "I’m not sure how I did it, but I’m one of the last people left.",
    "As further motivation to win, a screen starts showing the animals some of us will be reincarnated as.",
    "They include things like roaches, spiders and slugs.",
    "This begins to make people panic and form alliances, hoping any advantage will help them.",
    "The final round is a game of Russian roulette.",
    "Aren't we already dead?",
    "Is there a level of being more dead than this?",
    "I sit across from another me, the one person standing in my way.",
    "I either beat them or possibly come back as a slug.",
    "I have to win.",
    "We take turns spinning the revolver, placing it to our head and pulling the chamber.",
    "We go through multiple rounds of this.",
    "Finally, the other me shoots themselves.",
    "I win!",
    "I’m going to live as a human!",
    "The other versions of me all look furious.",
    "They watch as I appear on the screen, being reincarnated.",
    "But the rest of them do not turn into animals after all.",
    "It turns out that the winner is kind of the loser in this situation.",
    "They all get controllers and get to take turns controlling me.",
    "They control my actions, my dialogue and even my emotions.",
    "They make me do things I would never do.",
    "The only thing they can't control is my memory.",
    "I remember all of it and I hate it.",
    "Maybe I should have just been a slug.",
