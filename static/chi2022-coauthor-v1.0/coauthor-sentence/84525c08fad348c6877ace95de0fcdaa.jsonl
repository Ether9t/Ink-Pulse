    "You're Barack Obama.",
    "4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table.",
    "It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below.",
    "It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\" You're confused, who else could have those initials.",
    "You think about it for awhile, but you can't come up with anything.",
    "Stumped, you hold off on packing your bags for now, but call the number.",
    "The phone rings 9 times, and you're getting ready to hang up, but on the 10th ring , someone picks up.",
    "\"Hello?\" says a Boston-accented voice.",
    "It's Ted Kennedy, and he sounds drunk.",
    "\"I'm calling for JFK\" you say.",
    "\"Oh, he's not here right now, but I can take a message.\" His speech is slurred, and he sounds like he's drinking right now.",
    "Suddenly, he's gone, and someone else is speaking.",
    "\"Barack, it's John F.",
    "Kennedy.\"\n\nThe voice sure sounds like his.",
    "You think, then speak.",
    "\"Really?",
    "How are you alive?\" \"I'm not, but I'm still here.\" he says.",
    "You reply.",
    "\"I don't understand, how's that possible?\" \"The personality of every American president since LBJ has been stored in a secret government facility, and a few years ago, our program found a way to let us talk to our successors.\"\n\n\"That explains everything.\" you say.",
    "\"What do you want?\" \"I want you to continue my legacy, and I want you to do it my way.\" \"How can I do that?\" you ask.",
    "\"I'm going to send you a letter every day, and you're going to follow my instructions to the letter.\" You're skeptical, but you agree to do what he wishes.",
    "The next day, you receive your first letter.",
    "It reads: \n\nDear Barack,\n\nI want you to start by doing something that I never did.",
    "I want you to go to a gun store and buy a gun.",
    "Then, I want you to go to a shooting range and learn how to use it.",
    "Then call me back.",
    "JFK\n\nSo you go to the nearest gun store, and buy a Glock, and fill out the paperwork while the secret service detail rolls their eyes, and the gun store owner smirks.",
    "You also buy a box of ammunition, and luckily there's a range attached to the gun store, so you put in a pretty good day of shooting, and practicing.",
    "Then, you get another letter.",
    "\"Now, I want you to go to the White House, and kill everyone in the Oval Office.\" \"But that's just Joe Biden, and maybe that ugly woman who's vice president.\" \"I know.\" says the voice.",
    "Shrugging, you get in the limo and take the ride to the White House to meet your fate.",
    "This probably won't end well, but it beats spending the next 40 years throwing Covid parties at Martha's Vinyard.",
