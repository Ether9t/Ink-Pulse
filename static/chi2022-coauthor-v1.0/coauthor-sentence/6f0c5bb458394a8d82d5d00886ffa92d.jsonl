    "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you.",
    "You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.",
    "At first you watch in horror, but eventually you find yourself rooting for the guy.",
    "Moments in their lives begin to pass.",
    "They range from small moments to large ones.",
    "You are able to experience the emotions of when they were feeling the emotion.",
    "From simple things to enjoy your parent's meals to more elaborate events such as, your first prom date.",
    "Soon you find yourself once again watching yourself die.",
    "Immediately the version that succeeded you shows up in a seat next to you.",
    "They look at you with the same confusion you once shared.",
    "This process continues.",
    "It goes on and on.",
    "You realize that you're trapped.",
    "Is this Hell?",
    "Am I forced to sit here and be a spectator of my life?",
    "Never to be the one who makes the decision's and always a bystander?",
    "It is then that you are given a choice.",
    "You get up and walk away.",
    "You walk through the door and it closes behind you.",
    "The other versions of you don't follow.",
    "Maybe they've been through this before or maybe they're afraid of what change this choice may bring.",
    "Regardless, you choose to continue.",
    "You finally feel as you're in control of yourself once again.",
    "Regardless of what it may bring, at least you know it was because of the choice you were free to make.",
