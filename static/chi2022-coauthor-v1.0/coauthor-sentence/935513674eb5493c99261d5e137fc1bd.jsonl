    "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees.",
    "You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand.",
    "Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder.",
    "You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" At first you think your mind is playing tricks on you.",
    "\"Who said that?\" you ask nervously.",
    "The bee looks at you and says \"I did, Your Majesty.\" You jump up in terror.",
    "You feel like you're in a dream and wonder if you might be losing your mind.",
    "\"Is this some kind of joke or prank?\" you cry out, barely able to control your own voice.",
    "The bee looks at you with his tiny black eyes and says \"No, Your Majesty\".",
    "\"Why do you keep calling me that\" you ask.",
    "The bee looks at you and says \"Because you are the Queen of the Bees, Your Majesty.",
    "\"What does that mean?\" you exclaim \"how could that even be possible?\" The bee looks at you and says \"You are the last of the royal line\".",
    "As you talk to the bee it reveals the amazing story about the true nature of bees.",
    "You learn that bees are really alien lifeforms that came to earth and adopted the form of bees in order to help plants thrive on this planet.",
    "You also came from that alien planet as a baby and are in fact the queen of the bee race.",
    "Now it is time to take your place and lead the bees in their work to spread life across the universe.",
