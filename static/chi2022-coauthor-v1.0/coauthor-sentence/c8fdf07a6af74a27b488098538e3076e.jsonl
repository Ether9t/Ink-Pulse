And the bee said I need to put it up high in a tree so nothing can harm it. So I climbed a tree and I carefully tied my handcrafted beehive house up in the top of a tree. \"There, it's safe now,\" I said to the bee.\nThe next day, I could see hundreds of bees moving into the hive. \"They won't sting me will they?\" I asked my new friend. \n\"No, you are the queen and they will do anything for you,\" the bee replied. And then I had a great idea. \n\"Little bee I have a favor to ask of you,\" I told my friend. \n\"What is that?\" asked the friendly bee.\n\"I am so allergic to a bee sting. I am willing to be your queen and I will even stay and guard the hive if you do me this one thing. Can you make me not allergic to bee stings?\"\n\"I don't think I have the power,\" said the bee. \"But I can travel far and wide and tell all of the bees that you are my queen and that they can never sting you.\"\n\"That would be great!\", I exclaimed.  So a great deal was worked out. I kept the bees safe from harm and I was protected from being stung by bees again for the rest of my life. The end.",
