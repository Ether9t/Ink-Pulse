Fake Elon Musk doesn't suspect a thing. He pulls the curtains shut and climbs into bed with Christina.\n\nAs fake Elon Musk sleeps, Christina wakes up and quietly opens her purse and takes out her cell phone. She goes down to the secret prison and begins talking to the door. \"Who is in there, do you need help?\" She asks. She hears a faint voice from behind the door. \"What was that, sorry, you'll have to speak up.\" She says.\n\nThe voice behind the door gets louder and clearer, \"Help me!\"\n\nThe door is sealed with a coded lock. She thinks she knows the code to get in there. It's probably the birthday of fake Elon Musk's favorite fish. She enters the code and the door opens.\n\nChristina sees the real Elon Musk, he is gaunt and pale. He looks like he hasn't bathed in months. \"What is going on, are you his twin?\" She asks the real Elon Musk. \"No, I'm the real Elon Musk.",

This time, he has shapeshifted into Elon Musk and assumed his identity. He put the real Elon Musk in a small prison in his basement, feeding him ten apples a day and a small. bit of ham. The real Elon Musk is becoming frail. \n\nOne day, fake Elon Musk asks Christina, the woman he has been dating over and over before this, to move in with him. She agrees.
