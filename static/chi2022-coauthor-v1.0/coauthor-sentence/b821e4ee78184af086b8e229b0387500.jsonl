Will figures out a way that he can defeat the witches. The next time that they try to burn him with fire he will control the rain so that it won't hit the ground. The rain will just stop at the witches brooms height. The broom will get so wet that the witches will fall off and fall into the fire and perish.\n\nThe final battle has finally arrived and Will is fighting the witches. It is a stalemate to start but Will knows he has an ace up his sleeve. The witches play right into his plan and place a pit of fire underneath where he is flying. The fire begins to spread and covers the entire ground. Will recognizes this and instantly makes it rain. However the rain stops right at broom level. The rain is coming down like a downpour. The witches try their hardest to hold onto their broom but they slip and fall into the fire pit and are never heard from again. Will help saved his community and all the members within it. He was seen as a hero. He saved humanity.\n\n",
