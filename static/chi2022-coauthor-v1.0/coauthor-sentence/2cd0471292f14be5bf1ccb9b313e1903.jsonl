    "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out.",
    "She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.",
    "She meets him again, after he follows her to a bar.",
    "He is charming.",
    "The process starts again.",
    "She's dating him again.",
    "He comes over to her house for dinner one night.",
    "She has everything prepared very nicely.",
    "They enjoy their dinner.",
    "She asks him if he would like some dessert.",
    "He accepts and they sit out on the balcony, having dessert and wine.",
    "He keeps saying how much he appreciates her.",
    "She finds this odd, because they really don't know each other that well yet.",
    "She realizes she's starting to feel uncomfortable.",
    "There is something eerily familiar about the scene.",
    "She looks in his eyes, and sees only one thing: hunger.",
    "She's seen that hunger before.",
    "Her last boyfriend had it too.",
    "Now she sees it in this man and she suddenly realizes that she has somehow fallen for the same trap again.",
    "She has fallen for the man with no face, the one who is unable to be real or true.",
    "She doesn't realize that he is a shapeshifter, but she knows that she's seen this exact scene play out before.",
    "It didn't go well before and she has no reason to believe that it will go well this time.",
    "In fact, she has every reason to believe that it won't.",
    "She tells him that she's got a headache and would like him to leave.",
    "He seems startled by this.",
    "He asks her if she's breaking up with him.",
    "She tells him that they barely know each other, that there is no relationship to end.",
    "He looks so puzzled, she is taken back.",
    "She realizes that he has no idea what she's talking about.",
    "It is right then that she begins to suspect that something deeper is going on.",
    "She doesn't understand it, but she's starting to come to the realization that he is, in fact, the same man she just broke up with.",
    "She suspects that he is the same man she's broken up with many times.",
    "The realization that she's dating the same person over and over again is staggering.",
    "She asks him to leave, again.",
    "This time, he begs her not to ask him to go away.",
    "He begins weeping.",
    "She is stunned by what is going on.",
    "She has seen this act before.",
    "She walks to the door, opens it, and curtly says, \"goodnight.\" He leaves, but never takes his eyes off of her.",
    "She turns around, a bit spooked.",
    "Later that night she searches the internet for clues about what was going on with him.",
    "She is shocked to find that many women have had this same experience.",
    "She reads about shapeshifters and knows, in her heart, that this is what she's been dating.",
    "The woman joins the foreign legion and ships off, later that week.",
    "She never dates anyone again.",
