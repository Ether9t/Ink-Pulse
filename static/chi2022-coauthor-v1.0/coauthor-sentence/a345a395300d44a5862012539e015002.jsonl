I think the best dads are simply \"real\". They show their kids how to live, the good and the bad. They realize that kids need to fail, they tell their kids to try things and expect to fail every now and again. They are realistic. But the \"best\" dad. My god, this has to be some sort of super human, or higher power. I want to be like this, but i dont want to be perfect. Nobody is perfect, so to try and act perfect is not realistic to kids. Showing your faults and showing how you fall down sometimes is so important. Maybe i deserve to be on this list? Not because i am a perfect dad, but simply because i give my best effort. I am ok with failing as long as i do my best. If i do my best, than i have no regrets. Regrets in life are like an illness. I dont want them. Just like that the mug dissapeared..",
