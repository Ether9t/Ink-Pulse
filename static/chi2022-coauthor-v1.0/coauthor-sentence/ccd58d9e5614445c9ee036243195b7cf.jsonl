    "50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation.",
    "How could the United States have been the only one to follow the isolation.",
    "Didnt all the other countries agree to it?",
    "Why was the plan not followed through with?",
    "The answer to that question lies in the fact that the United States was the only nation to have a nuclear bomb.",
