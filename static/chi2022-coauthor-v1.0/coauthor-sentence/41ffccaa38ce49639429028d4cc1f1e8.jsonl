Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\nI was in my room, alone and at first I thought a human intruder has come inside the house. But their voice is too high pitched to be human. It was then I realized, the intruder is a tiny bee. I screamed on the top of my lungs.\n\n\"Get away from me, get away from me! I am deathly allergic to bees!\" I screamed.\n\n\"But that's the thing, Your Majesty. You are not allergic to us. You're one of us.\" said the tiny bee.\n\n\"That's.. that's impossible!
