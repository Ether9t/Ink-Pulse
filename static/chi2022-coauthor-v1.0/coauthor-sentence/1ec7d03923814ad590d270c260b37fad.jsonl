    "I am psyched to learn more about my next life.",
    "All these people around me that look like me is suspicious.",
    "I never get reincarnated in the same form.",
    "And so, the film begins with a scene of a man in a car, driving through a forest.",
    "\"Well that is just great\" I say aloud.",
    "\"I am a man in a car - not thanks.",
    "In a forest, yes please\" I say to no one in particular.",
    "This looks and feels more like a dream than reality.",
    "Nothing like making your own paths through the density of the forest, apparently having no idea where you are going.",

    "A small child appears from the side of the cottage, singing and skipping to Mark Knopfler's guitar.",
    "The man in the car gets out and walks towards the child.",
    "\"Hi Uncle Mark\" the child yells excited.",
    "Uncle Mark?",
    "It's none other than The Mark Knopfler.",

    "Mark and the child walk into the cottage with a quaint kitchen and stew simmering on the stove.",
    "\"Where is your dad?\" Mark asks.",
    "\"He is in the other room, playing with his guitar\" the child says.",
    "Mark was intrigued, being that there were no musical notes in the air.",
    "\"Hey Chester, guess who?\" Mark shouts.",
    "Still, no sound.",
    "Mark walks in to find his brother toppled over and perfectly still.",
    "Mark checks for a pulse.",
    "\"He is dead\" Mark says.",
    "The child begins to cry.",
    "I sure hope this gets better from here.",
    "I think I am Mark in my next life, so with my music I will deal with anything.",
    "The film stops, leaving all of us wondering, \"What next?\"\n"
