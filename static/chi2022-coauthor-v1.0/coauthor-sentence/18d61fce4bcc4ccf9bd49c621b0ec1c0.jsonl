JFK finally started to look a little relaxed. \"So, you ready for this?\" Obama just waited for an explanation. \"I know you've been waiting for this day for a long time. There's going to be a new white house. We need you to oversee operations there.\" \"What about the old white house?\" JFK paused for a moment, and then replied, ",
