    "You're Barack Obama.",
    "4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table.",
    "It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below.",
    "It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\" Puzzled, you call the number.",
    "A voice on the other end tells you to meet \"him\" in an hour at the Old Executive Office Building.",
    "Two hours later Obama is on a private jet to D.C..",
    "You wonder what this could be, and who could be responsible.",
    "You've held the most important job in the world, what else could there be.",
    "Not wanting to waste time, you are whisked from the landing strip to the Old Executive Office Building.",
    "There you are greeted by many past Presidents, all the way back to Eisenhower.",
    "\"Come with us, Barack,\" says Ike, to which you follow up a flight of stairs to a door marked \"EXECUTIVE\".",
    "It's here you hope to discover what is going on, how are some of these people still alive?",
    "What is the \"Important Job\" you must perform?",
    "You are sat down, an anonymous person approaches you, sits down, and begins to explain the situation.",
    "The past was just a dress rehearsal, Barack, this is the real thing.",
    "The Galactic Council needs leaders of exceptional talent, you had been selected to be leader of the free world as a prelude to being a leader of the galaxy.",
    "You are told you past with flying colors, but that there are many different worlds, and they all have their own challenges, and to be the best in the universe, you must be tested.",
    "Please step this way, your ship awaits, Your Majesty.",
