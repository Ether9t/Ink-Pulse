Russia stormed their country and prevented the attacks long enough for the USA to fight back and send troops into the country. The USA, Canada, Russia, and Africa fought back with all they force they could come up with, and knocked off Chiang Kai-Shek once and for all. The war showed that you can not really ever truly trust other nations, and it increased the use of espionage greatly. This event marked an important point in history.\n",
