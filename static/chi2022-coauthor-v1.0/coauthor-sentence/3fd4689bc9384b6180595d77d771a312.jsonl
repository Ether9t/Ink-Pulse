We have interactions with people every day, and during our formative years, if we learn to make the interactions smooth, we will have an easy life. If we don't, we will have a hard life. Think of most negative actions. Murder, war, divorce, famine-how many of these could we solve with better communication and empathy? \n\nI think that the most important thing I have learned in school is how to communicate with other people.
