Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder. You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" You look down and see a bee in a suit and tie. \n\n\"Little bee, please don't sting me,\" I said. \"I'm allergic and I will swell like a balloon if you do.\" \n\n\"I'm not going to sting you, Your Majesty,\" the bee said. \"Well then tell me, what do you want?\", I asked the bee. \n\n\"I'm here to help you with your duties as a queen,\" the bee said.

Since this bee was nice and didn't sting me, I was eager to help. I agreed to be their queen. I had quite the task of finding this evil queen so that I could destroy her. I had to go through a lot of obstacles to get to her, but I was determined to save my hive. My first obstacle was a giant spider web.  I used a stick and I got the spider web out of the way of the hive. My second obstacle was a giant bear. Apparently he wanted the honey made by the bees and didn't want to hurt me. I told the bear I was just after the evil queen and I wouldn't take any of the honey so he let me go. I told the bear if he would help me, I bet the bees would give him some honey and the little bee in the suit agreed. So the bear agreed to help me catch the evil queen. The third obstacle was a giant snake. It was guarding the queen just outside of the hive. The bear helped ",
