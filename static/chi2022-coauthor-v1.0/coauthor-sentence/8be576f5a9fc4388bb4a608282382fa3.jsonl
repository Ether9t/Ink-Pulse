    "Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had one hundred little pigs and not enough food to feed them.",
    "So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.",
    "You know the story about the first three little pigs.",
    "This is a story about the 92nd little pig.",
    "The 92nd little pig built a house out of depleted uranium.",
    "And the wolf was like, \"dude.\" Number 92 looked at the wolf inquistively.",
    "Wolf said \"there is no way you are a sibling of the three little pigs.",
    "You are just so outside the box.\" 92 looked around and said \"what box?' Oh man, the wolf was going to have fun with this one.",
    "\"Uranium is dangerous, you know.",
    "It gives off toxic fumes and leaks poison into the soil\" wolf told 92.",
    "92 shook his head and went inside his strong house of thick walls.",
    "There would be no huffing and puffing around here.",
    "Wolf will have to be very clever in his tradition of esconsing hand built piggy houses.",
    "Wolf was not clever enough.",
    "This takes some scientific mind to map out a strategy.",
    "Wolf decided to ask 92's cousin, porky pig.",
    "Porky was smart and always learning about the newest advancements.",
    "\"Sure I will help you get 92's house.",
    "I have never liked that cousin.",
    "We sill think of something.\" Porky said.",
    "In reality, Porky loved 92.",
    "Porky and 92 decided to come up with a plan that backfires on wold.",
    "They decided to meet in the morning to discuss their elaborate strategy.",
    "Yup, they came up with something foolproof.",
    "Wolf caught on though, and the backfire backfired.",
    "So who won this little tussle?",
