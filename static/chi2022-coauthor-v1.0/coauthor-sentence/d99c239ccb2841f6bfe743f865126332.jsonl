        "text": "Humans once wielded formidable magical power. But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect. When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again. One way or another the aliens had to be defeated.\n\nAnything could be risked because if the aliens were not defeated there would be total destruction. The aliens were not a threat to be negotiated with. They had to be destroyed. With fewer humans left following the invasions of the aliens to date the only way was to come together. \n\nThe humans had to be united. They had to pool all of their resources. The only way to do this was to use the power of the Mana. Let me tell you more about the Mana..\n\nThe Mana is the power of the Earth. It is a power the aliens do not have. It is a power that can be used to defeat the aliens. The humans come together and they learn how to use the Mana. They learn how to use the Mana to defeat the aliens. \n\nThe aliens have a weakness. They are vulnerable to the power of the Mana. It is gravity that benefits the humans most as gravity is a power of the earth. The aliens do not have the power of gravity. The aliens are vulnerable to the power of gravity. The humans set up traps on the ground and as soon as the aliens touch them they are destroyed. The remaining humans survive but never forget the ones they lost.",
