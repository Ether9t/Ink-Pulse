Anyone that drinks from this mug can easily...um...impregnate any woman in a 5-yard radius.\" \n\nAll of the reporters start yelling, \"What! Why on earth would anyone make a mug like that?\" \n\nThe officer responded. \"Well you see, it was for someone in particular that wasn't able to have kids of their own. This was sort of an experiment.\" \n\nThe reporters are still in shock about the mug's special powers. \n\nJust then, there was a loud sound coming from the sky. The reporters looked up and saw a man flying towards them. In a flash, he crash landed on the stage next to the officer. It was Santa Claus. ",
