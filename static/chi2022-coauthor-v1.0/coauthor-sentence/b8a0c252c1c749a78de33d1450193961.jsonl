    "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you.",
    "You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.",
    "You are surprised to see that all of these people are of different races, genders and backgrounds.",
    "They don't seem to share anything in common with you besides the fact that they are humans.",
    "You ask the others why they are all different, but no one has an answer.",
    "A few moments later you see your next life play in front of you, and it is that of a white American man.",
    "You continue to watch and see that this person is a successful businessman who has a young wife and stepchild, Harper Campbell.",

    "And more astonishingly, you realize that Harper is actually your daughter!",
    "This discovery sends you into a state of shock.",
    "You are astonished that Soeurette has remarried.",

    "You feel the pain he feels, and you feel the pain of every other person in the cinema.",
    "You become very angry at Soeurette.",
    "How dare she cheat on your future self?",
    "You realize she has not only been unfaithful to you, but is also likely an unfaithful person generally since she has repeated her bad behavior into the future.",

    "Soeurette is devastated but Matty's drastic actions serve her right.",
    "You are glad that she is being punished for her actions.",
    "The other people in the cinema are also very angry at her.",
    "They are relieved that she has been punished, and they encourage Matty to continue living his life without her.",
    "You see Matty move on with his life and you can tell he is extremely happy.",

    "You are glad that she is jealous of someone who has earned the love of Matty.",
    "Matty lives a long and happy life with Vivian.",
