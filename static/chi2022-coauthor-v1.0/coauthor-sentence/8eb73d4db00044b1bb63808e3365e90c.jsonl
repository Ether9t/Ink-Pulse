    "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees.",
    "You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand.",
    "Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder.",
    "You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\n\"Wait what\" I say?!",
    "The bee replies again \"Your Majesty, what are your orders\"?",
    "Am I going crazy I think.",
    "The bee says \"Don't be afraid I am only here to please you\".",
    "I'm stunned for a second and say \"Please don't sting me, I am very allergic\".",
    "The bee replies, \"Oh that won't be an issue, I would never sting you.\" I think ask \"How can I hear you talk?\" The bee replies, \"You are a very special human, you were born with something called the Beekeepers Gift.\" \"The Beekeepers Gift is a gift that allows you to control the bees\".",
    "\"You aren't allergic, your parents didn't want you to know about your gift until you were old enough\" the bee says.",
    "You look at the bee and start to wonder, \"Is it possible that I could be a queen?\" He says \"Well no you're more like an ambassador for humans and bees\".",
    "I ask, \"Well may I speak to the Queen?\" He says sure and takes me to them.",
    "He flies until we reach a colony.",
    "I approach nervously because again allergic to bees and the bees bow down.",
    "\"Wow is this really happening\", I think to myself.",
    "\"Your Majesty, I have brought her\" he says.",
    "The queen replies, \"The bees have told me all about her, it is time for the prophecy to come true\".",
    "\"Yes I think\" I reply.",
    "The Queen Bee then tell me about the bee population.",
    "She says due to deforestation and climate change the bees are struggling and I need to help so that their population can be saved.",
    "She says that I need to take volunteer bees and go around and start new populations across the continent.",
    "My reward would be all the honey I can take to sell to fund this expedition.",
    "I agree to fulfill the mission.",
    "The next few months I go around the US.",
    "Leaving groups of bees where I see fit so that they may flourish.",
    "I take the honey to sell to fund the trip.",
    "City to city, state to state, coast to coast I go.",
    "I finish the mission and go back to the queen.",
    "She tells me the mission is a success.",
    "She allows me more honey and I become a very successful beekeeper and are allowed to live out my life with the Beekeeper's Gift.",
