She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time. The woman's name is Soeurette, and the man that she keeps dating is named Tyler, although Tyler can take many forms. Sometimes Tyler goes by Matthew and other times he goes by Jake or Ben, depending on the identity that he's hoping to adopt in that moment. When Soeurette first met Tyler, she was in college. She actually got pregnant by Tyler in her sophomore year of college. When she told him about the pregnancy, he freaked out and left her. She was heartbroken, but she was also angry. She decided to move on with her life and put Tyler behind her. But Tyler realized that he was wrong to leave Soeurette. It had never been his intention to hurt her. No, he did care deeply for Soeurette and just didn't feel ready to be a father. So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later. He took on the identity \"Matthew.\" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her. He was so charming and sweet that Soeurette fell for him right away. They started dating and were soon engaged. But then, a month before the wedding, Matthew broke up with Soeurette. He said that he didn't want to get married after all. He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl. Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately. What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul? Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy. Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back. So this time he took on the identity \"Jake.\" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away. Jake was very handsome and successful. He was a successful businessman who owned a chain of restaurants. Soeurette was so happy to have found a man who was so good looking and successful.",
