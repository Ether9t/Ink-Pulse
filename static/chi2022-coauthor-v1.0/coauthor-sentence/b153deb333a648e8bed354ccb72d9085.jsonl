    "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out.",

    "The woman's name is Soeurette, and the man that she keeps dating is named Tyler, although Tyler can take many forms.",

    "So Tyler hatched a plan to reenter Soeurette's life just a year later.",
    "He took on the identity \"Matthew.\" He told Soeurette that he was a friend of Tyler's and that Tyler had told him all about her.",

    "He wasn't ready to be a stepfather to Soeurette's little girl.",
    "Soeurette was so angry with Matthew that she threw him out of her life immediately.",
    "What was it with men who couldn't commit for the long haul?",
    "Soeurette didn't realize that Matthew was actually Tyler, and that Tyler just got cold feet for the second time, just as he had upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy.",
    "Soeurette moved on with her life, but Tyler was determined to win her back.",
    "So this time he took on the identity \"Jake.\" When Soeurette first met Jake she was blown away.",

    "Soeurette got pregnant again.",
    "This time, Tyler was determined to be a good father.",
    "He did not walk out upon learning of Soeurette's pregnancy.",
    "No, he was going to be the father that Soeurette's daughter deserved.",
    "And he kept this promise.",
    "Finally, Soeurette had truly found the one, but little did she know, she had found \"the one\" all along.",
