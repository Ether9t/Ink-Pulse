    "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing.",
    "This, after all, is not the first time that Matt Damon has gone missing.",
    "The first time Matt Damon went missing, humanity had practically stopped in its tracks to try to find him.",
    "The alien is not aware that Matt Damon is a very important person to the human race.",
    "This is because Matt Damon has incredible talents.",
    "He is funny, personable and can even cast magical spells.",
    "He is also a master of disguise and can be anyone he wants to be.",
    "For example, Matt Damon can morph into a clown, or a doctor, or a lawyer, or a schoolteacher, or anyone else depending on his mood.",
    "With all these talents, skills and abilities, Matt Damon is arguably the most powerful human on planet Earth.",
    "So when the alien kidnaps Matt Damon, he really has no idea what he is up against.",
    "He is unaware that the human race will stop at nothing to retrieve Matt Damon.",
    "In fact, a group of humans based on Switzerland is immediately notified of Matt Damon's disappearance.",
    "They are called the \"Matt Damon Retrieval Team\" and they are the most elite group of humans on the planet.",
    "This Swiss team has a lot of powerful weapons at their disposal to try to get Matt Damon back on planet Earth.",
    "The alien is not aware of this, but he is about to get a rude awakening.",
    "The Swiss team sets out to find the alien in a spaceship.",
    "They set their sights on the planet where they know the alien is: Planet Borg.",
    "Planet Borg is zillions of lightyears away from the Swiss, but they are totally undeterred.",
    "They truly stop at nothing for Matt Damon.",
    "And so, as a result, the alien is not prepared for the blasts of rain and fire that he is hit with all of a sudden on Planet Borg.",
    "The Swiss have arrived!",
    "The Swiss team is not going to let the alien have his way with Matt Damon.",
    "They are going to get Matt Damon back, no matter what.",
    "They are going to get Matt Damon back, even if they have to destroy Planet Borg in the process.",
    "Matt Damon is relieved to see the Swiss.",
    "After all, the alien had been confining him to a small isolation room, where he was only allowed to eat hot dogs and watch the same Netflix show over and over again, on repeat.",
    "The alien had been very cruel to Matt Damon.",
    "So when the Swiss start blasting Planet Borg, Matt Damon knows he's in good hands.",
    "He is promptly freed and gives the alien a very sarcastic goodbye.",
    "The alien is not happy.",
    "He is not happy that he has been defeated by the Swiss.",
    "And yet there is nothing he can do about the situation, since he knows he does not have the tools at his disposal to fight back against the Swiss.",
    "So all he can do is lay back and take it.",
    "This angers him to no end, and he realizes he will have to be stealthier the next time he tries to capture a human from planet Earth.",
    "Never again will the alien try to kidnap Matt Damon.",
    "He has truly learned his lesson...",
