    "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing.",
    "The alien is a bit of a fanboy, and is trying to get Matt Damon to sign his autograph book.",
    "However, every time the alien takes human form and tries to get close to Matt, the alien either gets lost in a crowd and is ignored, or is stopped by security.",
    "Eventually, the alien resorts to extreme measures, and simply sucks Matt Damon up into his spaceship on a beam of light.",
    "Matt Damon is terrified and confused, but the alien quickly explains that he is merely a huge fan, and just wants an autograph.",
    "Matt Damon is not convinced, and the alien is forced to take Matt Damon to his home planet to prove that he is actually an alien, and not a crazed kidnapper who has built a hovercraft and disguised it as a spaceship.",
    "The alien is nonplussed, but agrees to travel across the universe with his favorite actor.",
    "The alien takes Matt Damon to his home planet, which is a barren wasteland, and explains that the planet was once beautiful, but the evil invaders wiped out most of the native aliens and destroyed all of the crops.",
    "Matt Damon is horrified, and he wants to know how he can help, using his star power on Earth and his reputation as a philanthropist.",
    "The alien, however, just wants to talk with his favorite celebrity, and not about the disappointing homeworld.",
    "So the alien then shows Matt Damon his collection of Matt Damon memorabilia, including a Matt Damon action figure, a Matt Damon lunchbox, and all of Matt Damon's movies on a kind of foreign recording medium that works in outer space without electricity.",
    "Matt Damon, being a celebrity, quickly forgets all about the famine and the invaders, and ends up basking in the admiration of yet another adoring fan.",
    "In fact, Matt thinks, he could make a fortune if the studios recognize all of the revenue that his movies are earning outside of Earth, so he asks for a tour of the planet, where he can meet more fans.",
    "The alien shows Matt Damon around, and a few of the locals are thrilled to see him, but most of them just ignore him.",
    "It turns out, that Matt Damon only has a few fans outside of the solar system, and only one of them has even watched his movies.",
    "Matt is disappointed, but he at least figures that he could get inspiration for a new movie from what he sees, so he asks to go to the library to learn more about the invaders.",
    "The alien takes Matt Damon to the library, and Matt Damon is shocked to see that the library is a tiny, one-room building with a single display screen in it.",
    "On that screen, Matt instantly watches the entire history of this planet, and all of his questions are answered.",
    "He asks to return to Earth, and even invites the alien to stay with him in Los Angeles.",
    "The alien, however, refuses.",
    "As much as he loves Matt Damon, the alien admits, he would rather live in a barren wasteland where his life is in constant danger, than have to live on the same planet as Ben Affleck\n\n\nTHE END\n"
