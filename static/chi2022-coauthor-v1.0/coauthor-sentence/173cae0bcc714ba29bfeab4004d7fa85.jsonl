    "The rest of the world now wants to help the United States recover, they want to show that they were not wrong in going into isolation.",
    "There is value in isolation and the United States has preserved many traditions.",
    "The other countries have something to learn from America, and vice versa.",
    "It is a perfect opportunity for the two to come together and learn from each other.",
