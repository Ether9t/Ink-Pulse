Now the cup read JO, and the R was being written and erased over and over. It was like some sort of puzzle or something. It was crazy though because it was my thoughts that filled in the next letter. I wondered what the point of finishing the name on the mug was, and if it was something that had to be done. Maybe this was some sort of therapy to me. I tried to remember what i was doing last when i fell into this dream like mode. Was I stressed, happy, anxious? Why am i deliberating how good of a dad I am? Just like that i woke up again, but this time really woke up. I asked my buddy where i was. He told me that i had taken some shrooms and was most likely hallucinating or in a trans.... Wow.",
