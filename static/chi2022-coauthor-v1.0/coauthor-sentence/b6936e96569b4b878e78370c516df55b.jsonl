You don't think you're worried, but you are a little nervous now that you're honest with yourself. \n\nThe thumb is swelling up fast! You feel like taking a nap as you get to the hospital, but you're breathing is tight - it takes too much effort. You're feeling a little sick. You figure everything will be taken care of, I might pass out but I just need to breathe, one breath at a time... \n\nYou wake up in a hospital bed, your mother is there. She smiles and asks how you feel. You feel tired, but can't remember getting out of the car! You feel relief as the doctor tells you you're fine. The swelling is gone, and you're breathing normally. You take a lesson from this, albeit not the obvious one: you and your mom share a calm approach to life, and you are very grateful to share this trait with her.",
