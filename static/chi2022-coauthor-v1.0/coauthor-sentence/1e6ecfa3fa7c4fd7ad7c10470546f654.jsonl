It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nYou call the number and a man answers. He says his name is Jack Kennedy. He says he signed it \"JFK\" to get your attention. He tells you that he's been watching you and he knows that you're the only man for the job. You're the only man who can stop the Russians. \n\nYou ask him what he means. He tells you that the Russians have been working on a project called \"The Doomsday Device\". It's a device that will destroy the entire planet. He tells you that the Russians are planning to use it.\n\nYou ask him why. He tells you that the Russians are afraid of the future. They're afraid of the way the world is changing. They're afraid of the way the world is becoming more open and free. They're afraid of the way that people are becoming more educated and more connected. They're afraid of the way that people are becoming more individualistic.\n\nJack tells you that the Russians have found a wormhole to Mars. They plan on living there while Earth burns. They plan on living there while humanity dies. \n\nJack tells you that you're the only man who can stop them. He tells you that you have to go to Mars. Elon Musk will help you! He'll give you a rocket. You'll need to get to Mars before the Russians do.  Once on Mars, you will use the wormhole to steal the Doomsday device. You will use the Doomsday device to destroy the Russian base on Mars. \n\n\"But why me?\" You ask. \n\n\"Because you're Barack Obama.\" Jack says. \"Nobody will think twice about you hobnobbing with billionaires on Mars.\"  \"There is a Gala event there this fall, and several presidents will be there. We didn't want to ask Trump, since he can't stay focused.\" \n\nYou agree to do it.\n",
