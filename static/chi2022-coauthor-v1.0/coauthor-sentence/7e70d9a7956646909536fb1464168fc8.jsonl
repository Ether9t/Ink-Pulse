And moreover, she is a bit of a gold digger, and a bit of a social climber, and a bit of a snob. She is not the nicest person in the world, and she is not the brightest bulb in the chandelier. So when Matt first introduced himself to her in college, she was immediately hooked, because Matt was a basketball player on the varsity team and Soeurette knew that Matt was an econ major, which meant that he would be rich someday. After all, she expected that he would go on to work at a prestigious bank in New York City, and this would mean that she would be able to live in a penthouse apartment, and drive a Mercedes-Benz, and wear designer clothes, and go on expensive vacations to St. Tropez. So, Soeurette was immediately attracted to Matt, and she fell head over heels in love with him. But Soeurette ends up breaking off the relationship because Matt was cheating on her at the time. A year later, Matt reenters her life and Soeurette is too dumb to realize that it's him, and she falls for him all over again. Matt again wrongs Soeurette by getting another woman pregnant, and Soeurette breaks up with him again. She cries, ",

So, Matt and Soeurette end up living the rest of their lives together, but it's a little uncomfortable because underneath their relationship is always the tension that Matt had habitually cheated on Soeurette for so much of their relationship, and that Soeurette had always been too idiotic to notice. So, this story's moral is that people should always go into relationships with their eyes wide open. ",
