You ask JFK to explain the contents of the letter and the man who answered your call responds, \"It's a job offer to come be my personal chef.\" \n\n\"But I'm retired,\" you say. \"Plus, I don't know how to cook. You know that, ever since I tried hosting that dinner party the one time and everyone got food poisoning.\"\n\nThe man who answered your call has no idea what you're talking about, even though JFK was certainly a guest at the dinner party you are referencing and most certainly must remember the horrible food poisoning he got from eating your attempt at roasted chicken with a side of mashed potatoes.\n\nSuddenly, you realize what must be going on. You must be living in parallel time zones or parallel worlds, because JFK is in one world and the man who answered your call is in another, even though both of these men are JFK. The theory is a little wonky but quite frankly, you're not sure what else to think. There is no other good explanation for these circumstances. The man who answered your call must have offered you the job as a chef because he doesn't realize, as the real JFK should realize, how bad your cooking skills are. \n\nYou feel a little weird that you must have your feet straddling two different time periods, but you decide to go with it. I mean, you've seen weirder things while living in the White House. You bid the two JFKs goodbye on the phone after explaining your theory of what's going on, and the two JFKs are surprised as well. Interestingly, that aspect of your life is the only one that you experience this split time zone experience over!",
