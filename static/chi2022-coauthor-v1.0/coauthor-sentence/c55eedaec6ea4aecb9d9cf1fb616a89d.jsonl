    "You're Barack Obama.",
    "4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table.",
    "It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below.",
    "It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\" You know what you have to do.",
    "You call the number.",
    "Ring, ring, ring.",
    "No answer.",
    "No answering machine either.",
    "You're perplexed and wonder if this is some prank from Michelle.",
    "You read the letter again and check your phone.",
    "Whoops, you entered the phone number incorrectly.",
    "So now you dial the right phone number and hear a voice on the other end.",
    "It's the voice of John F.",
    "Kennedy, the president who was assassinated in the 1960's.",
    "He informs you that you are to meet in exactly 1 hour to a location about 15 minutes away.",
    "You arrive at the location and see a man in a black suit, white shirt, and black tie.",
    "It's a man in black!",
    "He raised a tool up in the air and shined you in the face with a bright light.",
    "You're blinded and disoriented.",
    "You were whisked away in handcuffs into a van.",
    "Blindfolded now.",
    "You come to your senses and realize this was all a trap.",
    "Why would somebody do this, you wonder.",
    "You arrive at a facility and are greeted by a man in a white coat.",
    "Welcome to \"Reprogramming\" Barack!",
    "You faint from the surprise.",
    "You wake up in a white room with a white bed.",
    "The walls are padded.",
    "You check the door and it is locked.",
    "You check the windows and they are barred.",
    "You're trapped.",
    "Luckily, you still have your cyanide pill with you.",
    "You slip it into your mouth and die moments later.",
    "Nobody's gonna get that information out of you now.",
    "The end.",
