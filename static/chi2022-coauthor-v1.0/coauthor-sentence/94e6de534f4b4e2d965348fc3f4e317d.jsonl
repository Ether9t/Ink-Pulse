    "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees.",
    "You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand.",
    "Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder.",
    "You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" \n\n\nWhat do you do?",
    "\"I don't understand.",
    "Are you talking to me?\" you ask the bee.",
    "You are terrified this thing is going to sting you and ultimately cause your death.",
    "Frozen with fear, you hear a voice reply \"I am speaking to you, your Excellence.",
    "You are the controller of the bees, and I need to know what your next wish is for our colony.\"   \"I don't know what you're talking about, I'm deathly allergic to bees.",
    "\"That isn't true, sir.",
    "It's a lie that has been perpetrated and told to you to keep you from knowing your true identity and purpose,\" said the small yellow fellow.",
    "You are taken aback by this, but then you notice the bee is moving away from you.",
    "\"You need to follow me.",
    "I have something to show you which has been hidden from you all of your life.\" The bee begins to sly towards the tree line on you property.",
    "Hesitantly, you decide to follow.",
    "Once at the edge of the forest, the bee again lands on your shoulder.",
    "It's tiny voice seems to be directly in you ear.",
    "Telling you which way to go.",
    "You are walking deeper into the woods, and you finally arrive at the mouth of a cave.",
    "You have been in these woods so many times in your life, but never noticed this small opening.",
    "\"To find out who you really are you must venture into the darkness.",
    "Only then can you be illuminated with the knowledge of your existence,\" said the tiny bee.",
    "The cave is dark, but you can see the walls are covered in carvings.",
    "As you walk through the cave, you begin to understand what the carvings are.",
    "You see images of massive amounts of bees roaming freely, happy in their existence in the world.",
    "Then, there appears to bee some type of massive destruction, and the bees are suffering in the images and dying.",
    "As you continue to peer at the carvings, you come upon a person surrounded by rays.",
    "This person has your face!",
    "They look so strong and determined.",
    "You continue to walk further into the cave hoping to find out the meaning of the bee's cryptic words.",
    "What you find next causes you to freeze in your tracks.",
    "The carving shows the person directing the rays of light towards other humans.",
    "The light is shown wiping out factories and massive buildings.",
    "You realize you are the Keeper of the Bees and the person meant to save them from extinction.",
    "You gather your courage and exit the darkness with the new awareness of who you are.",
    "\"I know our next move,\" you tell the bee.",
    "\"Shall I ready the troops, sir,\" the small creature asks.",
    "You nod in reply.",
    "You are determined to fulfill the prophecy of the carvings and wipe out the polluters and destroyers of the environment.",
