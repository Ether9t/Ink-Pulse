It was a way to do that even if it wasn't at all what he had hoped for. He would shape shift into her and basically just hang out around her apartment while pretending to be her. It was quite the unusual love story. \n\nEventually she asked him to move in with her. He of course agreed. Now he was living with her, and they were spending all of their time together. He no longer had an identity of his own, even if they were just ones he had created while shape shifting. Now he was her all of the time. He was her boyfriend, at least in his head. In reality he was just a fascination for her. You can't always pick how you will be loved but you must accept it. ",
