    "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.",
    "Today was Father's Day and I was excited to give my father a mug, that I had especially engraved with the words \"*#1 Dad\".",
    "I even had the mug engraved with his name because I felt it added an extra touch of love.",

    "I asked what was wrong and he said, \"the mug has changed\".",
    "I did not know what he meant, so I looked at the mug, and to my shock, the mug no longer said \"#1 Dad\".",
    "The mug now said \"#25th Dad\".",
    "My father asked if it was some cruel joke.",
    "How could the mug just change on its own?",
    "Someone must have played a prank on me from the store where I bought the mug.",
    "I told my father that I did not know what happened and that I would go back to the store to get a new mug.",

    "He took us shopping and to special events in our community.",
    "He even started to cook dinner every night.",
    "He also read many books on how to become a better father.",
    "It was a happy moment for us all because he was spending a lot of time with us, but it was also saddening because he felt unworthy of being a great father.",
    "None of it was true, he was the best dad in the world to me.",
    "I knew it, and my mother did as well, but he did not.",
    "He became sad and depressed because he was using so much of his time and energy into becoming the best dad.",

    "He stopped going to work and had turned his back on his faith, his church.",
    "He had become a different man and a different person.",
    "He was no longer the father I knew and loved.",
    "I felt like I was losing my father slowly, but surely.",
    "My mother and I felt guilty for not seeing his downfall sooner.",
    "We felt that we had taken him for granted.",
    "We felt that we should have seen the signs and done something about it.",
    "I realized that my father was the best dad because he had spent so much time with us, after the mug changed in front of his eyes.",
    "It meant so much to him, that he did everything in his power to prove it to himself and us.",

    "I told him that he was the best dad in the world and that he did not have to prove it to anyone.",
    "I said he was the \"#1 Dad\" to me and that the mug did not take that away from him.",
    "He had always been there for my family and we loved him for that.",
    "He was a great father and I did not need a mug to tell me that.",
    "He looked at me and the sadness lifted from his face, his being, his essence.",
    "He smiled, hugged me and told me that he loved me.",
    "My family learned a tough lesson that day.",
    "Material objects mean nothing, when you have each other.",
