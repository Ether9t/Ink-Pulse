    "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees.",
    "You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand.",
    "Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder.",
    "You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" \n\n\"Go away!\" The bee objects.",
    "\"But Your Majesty, do you not wish to have your morning breakfast?\" \n\n\"I'm not hungry.\" The queen was certainly not used to being spoken to by anything as lowly as a bee.",
    "\"But Your Majesty, you must eat.\" the bee begged.",
    "\"It is your big today.\" \n\n\"What's so big about it?\" The bee twirled about excitedly.",

    "\"Married?!",
    "This is untrue!\" The queen was furious.",

    "I pride myself on my independence.\" the queen said with her head held high.",
    "\"Your Majesty, you will be a good wife and queen.",
    "Besides, the family has offered to throw in a private island and a new castle for you and your beloved.\" \n\nThe queen thought for a moment, and finally let out a long sigh.",
    "\"Well, I suppose I could do with a husband.",
    "Alright, when do I meet him?\" \n\n\"Right now, Your Majesty.\" the bee said and twirled about with a smile.",
    "\"Shall we, my dear?\"\n"
