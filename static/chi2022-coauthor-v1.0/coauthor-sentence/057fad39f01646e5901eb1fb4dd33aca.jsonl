        "text": "You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"\n\nAs Barack Obama receiving this letter, I am very confused. Is this a joke? Is this real? He wondered if JFK contacted him from the dead or if someone was playing a trick. He thought about it for a few minutes and decided to call the number. It rang and then a man answered. \"Hello,\" said the man on the other line. \"This is John F. Kennedy.\" Obama didn't believe it. \"No way,\" he said. But the man on the other line said, \"Look out your window.\" \nSo Barack looked out the window and saw JFK standing outside. \"Are you a ghost?\" asked Barack. \"No,\" said JFK. But there was no time for talking about that. JFK had to get to the real mission at hand. \"I need you to come with me to the future,\" he said. \n\"Okay, I'm retired so I may as well,\" said Barack. And then he met JFK outside where there was a time machine. It was a DeLorean just like in Back to the Future. So he gets in and they take off. \"Where are we going?\" asked Barack. \"To the year 2040,\" said JFK. \n\"And why are we going there?\" he asked. JFK told him it was because the world was in danger. They had to save the planet from the future hostile alien race that was taking it over. \n\n\"Okay, I'm in,\" said Barack. So when they got to the future they realized in 2040 all previous presidents have magic powers that can destroy aliens.  ",
