    "You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\" \n\n\"Did you just talk to me?,\" I asked the bee.",
    "\"Of course, your Majesty,\" said the bee.",
    "\"Why are you calling me your Majesty?,\" I asked.",
    "\"Because you are the Queen, of course,\" said the bee.",
    "\"How long have I been the Queen?,\" I asked.",
    "\"Since the day you were born, your Majesty,\" said the bee.",

    "I would like you to do my bidding,\" I said.",
    "\"I shall do whatever you command,\" said the bee.",
    "\"One more question though.",
    "If you stung me, would I die?\" \n\n\"You would, but I would die with you,\" said the bee.",
    "\"Okay, please don't sting me then.\" \n\nThe bee flew away.",

    "A few days later, I was stung by a bee.",
    "I was fine.",
    "I didn't die.",
    "It just stung a little bit.",
    "The bee died, but it didn't talk this time.",
    "It was just a normal bee.",
    "No other be ever tried to talk to me again.",
