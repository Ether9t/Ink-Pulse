    "When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.",
    "There is this odor that certain people exude.",
    "It's both familiar as well as off-putting.",
    "You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home.",
    "You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.",
    "It's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks.",

    "You choose now and jab the needle into your neck.",
