    "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.",
    "I love my dad, but I know he has his flaws.",
    "He hasn't been the best dad in the world.",
    "You will have a hard time getting him to believe that.",
    "When all the \"#1 Dad\" mugs started to change, I rushed over to my dad's house to see where he ranked.",
    "At first, he thought I was playing a trick on him.",
    "He thought I replaced his old mug with a new mug.",
    "When I took a look at the mug, I had to let out a laugh.",
    "I saw one phrase: \"#1,599,345,345 Dad\".",
    "My dad was around the 1.6 billionth best dad in the world.",
    "Considering there are billions of people in the world, that number is actually better than thought.",
    "It still is a long way from #1 though.",
    "This did make me think that maybe I was too hard on my father for how he raised me.",
    "We all make mistakes.",
    "Especially, when we are younger and just trying to make it through the world like my dad.",
    "I know that he loves me and that he was always trying his best.",
    "I chose not to let me dad know that the number on the mug was a true ranking.",
    "I know that my dad will never be the best dad in the world, but he is the best dad for me.",
    "I think enjoying my time with him while he is here on this earth is better at nitpicking on how he didn't measure up to other people's parents.",
    "I decided to take my dad out to eat and celebrate.",
    "I wanted to show him that I loved him and that I was proud of him.",
    "Also, it is not everyday that I get to eat out with the \"#1,599,345,345 Dad\" in the world.",
