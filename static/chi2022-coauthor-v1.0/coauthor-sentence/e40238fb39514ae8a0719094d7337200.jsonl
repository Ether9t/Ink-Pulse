You decide to call the number that is listed in the letter. To your surprise, it's a real number. As you place the call, you can't help feeling that your life is about to change forever. You are right! The voice on the other end of the line is familiar...it's John F. Kennedy! You are absolutely stunned that JFK is actually alive. You stammer when you hear is voice. Then he says \"Don't worry Barack, I know you're shocked...I'd be too if I were in your shoes. But honestly, you have nothing to fear. Just book a ticket to meet me tomorrow in the Caribbean.\" You are not actually sure if you can just drop all of your plans to head to the Caribbean to meet JFK. After all, you and Michelle were supposed to meet your neighbors for a game of checkers on their porch tomorrow, and then you and your friends were going to meet for some BBQ at Smith's BBQ Joint in downtown after that. But you are also intrigued. Checkers and BBQ will have to wait. You book the first flight to the Caribbean you can find. You arrive at JFK's private island. He's already there waiting for you. You are beside yourself with excitement. How crazy is it that this man is still alive? What a strange and fantastic thing to experience! JFK dives into the details. He tells you that he's been in hiding all these years, working on a secret project. It involves creating a new superpower that will rival the United States of America. He tells you that he wants your help to implement the project. You are honored. However, you can't help but think that this superpower would be unpatriotic, especially if it is to rival the U.S. But JFK assures you that there is no such thing as an unpatriotic project. He says that the purpose of the superpower is to encourage the U.S. to continue innovating so it doesn't lose its edge. He says that the superpower is just to motivate the U.S. so it doesn't get too lax about its policies and then lose out to other countries that are real. You are interested in the premise of this superpower and on second thought think this sounds like quite a good idea. JFK has already drawn up the plans for the superpower in his lab. He says that all you need to do is bring these plans back to DC and introduce them to the White House. He tells you that they'll take it from there. You agree that you will speak with your colleagues in the White House.  JFK is delighted to have your assistance and tells you that you absolutely won't regret this. The next day, you fly back to the White House and float JFK's ideas past your colleagues. They are skeptical, but agree to implement the project since they don't want to offend you and call you crazy. You promise them that the superpower is a good idea and will in fact motivate the U.S.",

        "text": "You're Barack Obama. 4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table. It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below. It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\" You have no idea if this is a hoax or not. After all, hasn't JFK been dead for years? Has he really risen from the dead just to send you this letter? Perhaps one of your kids is playing a prank on you. But you can't shake the feeling that it's real.
