When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. You are appalled to realize how bad the side effects are. Of course, you do not have any of these side effects, since the drug was only given to people who are younger than you.

You are 28 years old. You decide to go to a university to find the scientist who invented the drug. You find the university and the scientist's lab. You walk in and introduce yourself. You tell the scientist that you are from the future and that the drug he invented will have terrible side effects. He does not believe you. You try to convince him more by elaborating on how nasty the side effects will be. He still does not believe you. After all, he is convinced that any drug that has such miraculous anti-aging properties is going to be well worth its costs. He does not see much merit to your argument, especially when he cannot believe that you are a being from the future. You realize that you have to do something drastic to convince him.
