Out of the approx. 1 1/2 million cup holders, (this is ONLY the surviving legible relics really, broken ones that are unreadable are excluded from ranking, eliminating a surprising number of crockery.) my rank is lowly, but not in awful company. I'm in the middle, at a ranking of 767,198 I'm above a surprising number. To me, no shock, to Junior, a question that now is raised, makes him curious and a bit hurt.\n\nJunior seems more hurt than I would have imagined. Ok, so this is what I'll say. I'm writing this out here, so I can refine it and perhaps change my mind before it's too late. ",
