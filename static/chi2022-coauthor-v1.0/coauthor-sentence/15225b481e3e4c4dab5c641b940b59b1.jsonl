    "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you.",
    "You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.",
    "Before the main feature starts there are some previews of other things.",
    "One of these is a film about a man who has been reincarnated as a fly.",
    "You watch with little interest until you realize that the man is you.",
    "You wonder what's going on, were you really a fly in a past life?",
    "Or, even worse, is this your fate for the future?!",
    "The film is a comedy, but it has a serious message.",
    "This is the life you could have lived if you had decided to do something very bad in a previous life.",
    "Luckily you made the right choice and avoided the life of a fly.",
    "Another preview begins to play.",
    "It is the story of a man who has been reincarnated as a dog.",
    "You wonder if, again, this dog was you.",
    "Sure enough this is a life you could have had in a previous reincarnation.",
    "Had you not been bold and followed your dreams you would have been this dog in your last life.",
    "Not as bad as being a fly, perhaps, but still not great.",
    "Another preview plays.",
    "This time you are shown a being of great power living a life of pure joy.",
    "You learn that this is the life you could have had if you had fulfilled all of your potential in your previous lives.",
    "You are told that you won't actually be seeing your next life as that life is up to you to live.",
    "The reason you were brought here is to understand the ramifications that your actions have on your upcoming reincarnations.",
