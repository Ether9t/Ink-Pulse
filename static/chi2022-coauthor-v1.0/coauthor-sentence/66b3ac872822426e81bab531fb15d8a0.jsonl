    "As the movie began, I was very surprised to see that in this lifetime, I had become a cat.",
    "I was very surprised to see that I was a cat, but I also thought that it made perfect sense.",

    "The movie went on to show me that I had been a cat for many years and had lived a happy, complete life.",
    "I lived with an old woman in a large house, and I was free to go outside and roam whenever I pleased.",

    "I got to go back with my elderly companion and she lived about another week.",
    "As she was dying, she told me to be a good girl and that she would always be looking after me.",
    "I had a new home to go to so I was ok, but I never forgot my kind caretaker and the friendship we had.",
    "As the movie of my cat life ended, I was pleased for having found a different kind of love in another life.",
    "The end.",
