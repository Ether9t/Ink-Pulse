    "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out.",
    "She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.",
    "\"Maybe it was the hair?\" he asked himself.",
    "He watched in the mirror as his hair changed from black to brown, lingering a moment before cycling through several hair styles and colors at double speed.",
    "His face was unmoved as his hair changed from a short, tight cut, to long black bangs that obscured his eyes.",
    "He stopped on this selection, whipping the hair out of his eyes.",
    "\"You're getting much better at this,\" he said, giving himself a smile.",
    "\"Was she intimidated by the army guy look?\"\n\nHe shifted his torso from its tall chiseled towards a more modest, modern athletic dad.",
    "He briefly poked the slight love handles that had developed around his waist.",
    "BEEP BEEP BEEP\n\nHe spun around and stopped the alarm clock.",
    "It was time to go.",
    "---\n\nHe arrived at the bar.",
    "It was full of hipsters; the kind that dressed up in thrift-store clothes and called themselves 'retro'.",
    "He scanned the venue looking for her.",
    "When his eyes alighted on her, his breath caught in his throat.",
    "She wore a glittery blue top that stood out in the low light.",
    "Her hair was long and black, but the blue garment brought out some reddish highlights.",
