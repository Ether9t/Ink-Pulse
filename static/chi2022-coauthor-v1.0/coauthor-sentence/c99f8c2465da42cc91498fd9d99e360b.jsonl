    "Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts.",

    "The results have been devastating.",
    "The world lies in ruins, and countries are continually at war with one another.",
    "Now, only the United States has returned with technology that could change the world.",
    "While they were in isolation, the government of the United States commissioned a small group of scientists to research how to instill peace in others.",
    "This group was called, quite appropriately, the peacemakers.",
    "The consisted of twenty men and women from various cultures, ethnicities, and gender identities.",
    "They devoted their full lives to this research, to prove that the world could be at peace.",
    "They had no idea of the devastation and destruction going on outside the borders of their own isolated world.",
    "They only knew they had to find a way to achieve peace everywhere, should a war occur again.",
    "Upon seeing the devastation that has occurred throughout the globe, the peacemakers know they must use their knowledge to garner peace everywhere.",
    "It is their duty to make sure the world never falls into chaos again.",
    "Their research has shown that to do this, they must release a chemical agent over every populated area in the world.",
    "The chemical is like a medicine.",
    "A drug that calms people down and frees them from hostility and anger.",
    "This chemical causes people to forget why they are fighting and to lose all destructive tendencies.",

    "The wars stop.",
    "The world returns to life everywhere as if nothing bad has been happening for the past half a century.",
    "The peacemakers are thrilled that their research and efforts have been so effective, and they return to all of the pilots to the US for a celebration.",
    "Suddenly, one of the pilots sends out a distress signal.",
    "Then another one comes in and another.",
    "Terrified, the US government and the peacemakers listen to the terrified calls.",
    "Aliens are attacking the planet and destroying everything.",
    "It seems they had been controlling the peacemakers actions over the years in an effort to take over the world.",
    "The chemical that was released on April first has taken away any instinct humans would have had to fight the aliens off and save ourselves.",
    "How appropriate is was released on the first of April.",
    "The joke is on planet Earth.",
