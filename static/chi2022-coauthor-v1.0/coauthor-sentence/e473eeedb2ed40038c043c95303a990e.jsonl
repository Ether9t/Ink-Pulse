    "Humans once wielded formidable magical power.",
    "But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect.",
    "When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.",
    "I brushed the sleep out of my eyes.",
    "and groggily sat upright.",
    "I had long grown used to the booming guns of the alien ships in the distance, but it was something else that had awakened me.",
    "I could feel it.",
    "None of the other resistance members were awake, and it appeared to be only myself and those on watch awake.",
    "There was a ringing, a faint sound of a crystal tinkling.",
    "It was a sound I had heard before, in my dreams.",
    "I had been having the same dream for the past few nights.",
    "In dream, in the mists of early morning, I followed the sound to a hollow near the creek, never quite able to locate the source.",
    "But tonight, I was not sleeping.",
    "I was wide awake, and I knew exactly where to go.",
    "I hurriedly dressed, and stood up.",
    "Coulter was on duty, and gave me a faint salute as I left the edge of the camp.",
    "\"Do you hear anything odd?\" I asked him.",
    "Coulter looked at me questioningly.",
    "\"Just the  gunfire over the city\", he said, peering around alertly.",
    "\"No, not that\", I said.",
    "\"A  tingling buzz?\" \n\n\"No, nothing like that\", he said, and shrugged.",
    "I nodded at him, and then headed out of the camp down the ravine.",
    "The sound grew louder.",
    "This time, however, unlike in my dreams, I could now see the source.",
    "There was a large oak tree, glowing, beckoning me towards it.",
