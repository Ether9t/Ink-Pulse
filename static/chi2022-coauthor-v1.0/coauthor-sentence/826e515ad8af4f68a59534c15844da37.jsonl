    "You're Barack Obama.",
    "4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table.",
    "It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below.",
    "It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\"   You call the number, and are told to meet your contact at JFK airport in 3 days.",
    "\"Who is this mysterious contact?\" you say out loud to yourself.",
    "You fly into JFK and immediately notice your contact waiting in the terminal.",
    "It's an younger looking, well built man in a pair of black jeans and a grey Old Navy hooded sweater without the hood over his face.",
    "He is also clean shaven.",
    "As you approach, he extends his hand in greeting and says \"Pleased to meet you Mr.",
    "President, I am George Washington.\" \n\nYou shake his hand and ask \"George Washington?",
    "Thee George Washington?",

    "You fly back to the white house, and go to the location he showed you, and sure enough there was the nuke bomb.",
    "It was a rudimentary device, but enough to level the area around it.",
    "Lucky for you, you watched a YouTube video on how to safely disarm the device.",
    "You worked fast, and were successful, saving the lives of millions.",
