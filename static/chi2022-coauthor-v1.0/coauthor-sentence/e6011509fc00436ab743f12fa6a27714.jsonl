    "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.",
    "This is a tumultuous time for Dads everywhere because they have no idea how the ranking system works.",
    "Some mugs can't even fit the numbers on them due to how many dads there are in the entire world.",
    "All of the Dads, everywhere, collectively lose their minds.",
    "They want to get to the bottom of it.",
    "As the Dads try to figure out how they are ranked, more and more dads in the world realize their ranking isn't what they were.",
    "Some dads don't even care and figure that the rankings are pointless anyway.",
    "Eventually, a high ranking Dad realizes that the rankings are based on the number of kids that each dad has.",

    "And as long as your child gifts you a #1 Dad mug, that's all that matters.",
    "If your child considers you to be the best Dad in the world, simply put...nobody else's opinion matters at all.",
    "We all strive to be the best parent that we can possibly be.",
    "Getting that reaffirmation and love from our children means everything.",
    "The Dads learned a lesson because of the changing of the mugs.",
    "They all realized that at the end of the day, rankings don't matter.",
    "Your family and your children matter.",
    "Prioritize them at all times.",
