    "Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts.",
    "50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation.",
    "We discover that a new war had broken out.",
    "It made World War III look like nothing.",
    "The world was in ruins, and the only nations that were left were the ones that were able to protect themselves from the war.",
    "By just isolating the United States had somehow prevented its own demise.",
    "The other countries had some kind of issue that had escalated to the point of no return.",
    "Now it was up to the United States to try and get the world back up and running.",
    "The only problem was that the United States was in no shape to do so.",
    "We had struggled during that time from the lack of trading and having access to foreign technologies.",
    "We had to rebuild everything.",
    "We just weren't in the best situation to do so.",
    "We asked for volunteers who would go to different areas of the world to start helping rebuild and to help survivors.",
    "Many volunteered to go to what are considered nicer countries.",
    "Few volunteered for the already poverty stricken areas.",
    "Once people set up around the world, it started to rebuild.",
    "We were able to get the world back up and running, but it was a very slow process.",
    "There was one thing we didn't expect though.",
    "The very people who we sent over ended up siding with the local inhabitants.",
    "This ended up causing yet another world war.",
    "It went on and many of the already limited population died.",
    "It was then decided that we would all isolate yet again for another 50 years.",
    "We just hoped that things wouldn't be even worse when we emerged.",
    "That couldn't happen twice, right?",
