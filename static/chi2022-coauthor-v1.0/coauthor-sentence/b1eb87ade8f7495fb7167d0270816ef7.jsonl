    "An alien has kidnapped Matt Damon, not knowing what lengths humanity goes through to retrieve him whenever he goes missing.",
    "The aliens are determined to figure out what makes Matt Damon so special that thousands of people would risk their lives to get him back.",
    "They begin running tests on him.",
    "Is it a biological thing?",
    "No, it's not.",
    "They then begin to realize it's just a boyish charm, something they can't themselves have.",
    "So they come up with a plan to clone him, but unfortunately for them the cloning machine malfunctions.",
    "They get a bunch of clones of Matt Damon.",
    "However, none of them have the same charm.",
    "They are just like an every day, average guy.",
    "Apparently you can't replicate Matt Damon's one of a kind quality.",
    "So the aliens have no choice but to keep all of these clones locked in a cage.",
    "They know that people from Earth will soon show up to rescue him.",
    "They begin trying to find the clone that is the closest to the real Matt Damon.",
    "They will then send that one back to Earth and announce to the world that Matt Damon has been found.",
    "They find one that is close.",
    "He is a little too smart and not charming enough but he'll do.",
    "So they dress him up as Matt Damon and send him back to Earth in an escape shuttle.",
    "Earth is very happy to have him back and cancel the rescue mission.",
    "All is well for a little while.",
    "However, subpar Matt Damon movies begin coming out on Earth.",
    "No one is sure what is off about them.",
    "They just don't seem to be the same.",
    "People just put up with his new lackluster movies out of a sense of duty.",
    "Meanwhile the real Matt Damon is making movies for the aliens of space.",
    "They are huge hits and he enjoys being an intergalactic celebrity.",
    "He gets along with the aliens and enjoys his life.",
    "Sometimes he'll request that they kidnap a co-star for one of his movies but in general he just has fun working with upcoming alien actors.",
