    "You're Barack Obama.",
    "4 years into your retirement, you awake to find a letter with no return address on your bedside table.",
    "It reads \"I hope you've had a chance to relax Barack...but pack your bags and call the number below.",
    "It's time to start the real job.\" Signed simply, \"JFK.\" You call the number and are greeted by a voice on the other end.The voice simply gives you an address and a time.",
    "It seems foolish to follow such cryptic instructions but something is compelling you to.",
    "You arrive at the address and are greeted by a man in a black suit.",
    "The man has a somber face and a small private jet is behind him.",
    "He wordlessly nods and takes your bags to load onto the plane.",
    "He directs you to a staircase to board the plane.",
    "You follow his instructions helplessly.",
    "Your curiosity has gotten the best of you.",
    "You board the plane and sit in a plush leather seat.",
    "After a few moments another man boards the plane.",
    "He is in a well tailored suit with no label.",
    "He takes off his sunglasses and reveals a handsome, but forgettable face.",
    "He reaches out his hand to grasp yours.",
    "As he shakes it he introduces himself as JFK.",
    "Seeing the confusion in your face he laughs and says \" Oh no.",
    "I'm the REAL JFK.",
    "Jason Finn Killigan at your service.",
    "And now you are about to really serve your country.\"\n\n\n\nHe hands you a file and you begin to read.",
    "You soon have the bare bones of it.",
    "Each president has only been a puppet on an audition.",
    "It is after their term has ended that they are invited to participate in the real decision making if they are deemed worthy.",
    "After you finish reading, JFK looks at you expectantly.",
    "You're still unsure, but retirement has been boring so far.",
    "So with a big grin you tell him that you're in.",
    "He sits back in his seat in relief as the plane taxis down the runway.",
