It's also the only country that has the ability to travel to space. The world is now a powder keg, and the U.S. is the only one with a match. The United States has three choices.

The United States has a small army, but it has the most advanced weapons in the world. Whats the point in having a large army when you can win the war without using it. The United States has a plan.  The plan is to send a team of soldiers to every country in the world, and to take over the country without firing a shot. Imagine having the world at your fingertips and the decision on what to do with it.  You can choose to rule the world with an iron fist, or you can choose to be a benevolent ruler. The world is your oyster. Other nations cowarded in fear when they heard about the US and their arsenal. Countries begged and surrendered before the US even had initiated contact with them. The US was the world superpower that quickly. The US was the most powerful nation on Earth.",
