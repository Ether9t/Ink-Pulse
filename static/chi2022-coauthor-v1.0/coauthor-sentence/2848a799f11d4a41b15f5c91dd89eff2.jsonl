She welcomed us inside. \"You're home,\" she told us as we sat down in the lobby chairs with here. We were each given a new immortality drug that the young didn't know about. It turns out we landed in a town filled with the \"lost\" who had all escaped like we did. With this drug created by one of the Lost we were also able to live forever.
