They all look young, beautiful and healthy. You are not, and neither are your fellow companions of your same age. This is because people who are just two years younger than you in theory received the drug many years ago and still look like they are 26. So you wonder if it's really worth it for you to stay in this state where you won't be able to die. Is this an existence you want? Of course not. You also know that if you decide to go into the bathroom and end it all, your nurse will likely stop you. But you also wonder if there's any way to circumvent her. She is willing to help you now, but what if she looks away just long enough for you to get up and grab that prescription bottle on the counter? You decide to distract her. “Hey, what are you doing tonight?” you say. She checks the calendar on her phone to see if she has any plans scheduled. While she looks her plans up, you snatch the prescription bottle on the counter. She is still looking up her plans and decides to check the weather app too, so she doesn't notice that you've grabbed the bottle. She's now scrolling through pictures on her phone. You decide to down the whole bottle of pills since she is still not looking. As you swallow, you begin to feel woozy. You begin to feel the initial effects of the pills. Unfortunately, you realize once the bottle of pills is down in your stomach that you are still immortal, which means the searing pain and hot flashes you now feel will not actually kill you. You begin to feel stupid. What were you thinking?",

Your government decides to give the drug to all citizens under 26, but you and the rest of the “Lost Generations\" are deemed too high-risk. When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.

You can't take care of many of your basic needs. In fact, you have a hospice nurse who stays with you on most days.
