He left her his number.\n\nThe next day the woman woke up and saw that number and had no idea what happened. She called that person and he explained to her what happened. He asked her if they could meet up and she agreed. She wanted to meet a man who comforted her at her most vulnerable. A full year went by and they got along, dated and the man ended up proposing to her. They are scheduled to marry in about 4 months. As for the shapeshifter, he ended up losing that ability and everyone began to see him for what he was. A man who had Napoleon complex and was actually 5 feet 2. He was trying to live a life that he thought he would love but at the end of the day, he forever remained unhappy and unfulfilled. The woman dodged a bullet.",
