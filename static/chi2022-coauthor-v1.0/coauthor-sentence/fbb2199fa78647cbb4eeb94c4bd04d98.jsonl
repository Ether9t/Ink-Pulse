You look around, trying to figure out what happened. You're still in the bee field, but all the bees are gone. You decide to walk home, the buzzing in your head finally fading away.\n\nHow has this happened? What does it mean for you? You're not sure what you've gotten yourself into. You just know that you have to keep your hive safe. You won't let anything happen to them.",
