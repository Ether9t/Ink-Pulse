    "Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts.",
    "50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation.",
    "Now, the US must fight to secure their place in the world again.",
    "They set up a meeting with the new UN.",
    "Once there they realize how much things have changed.",
    "The US no longer has the power it once had.",
    "Even third world countries now have more say than we do.",
    "In fact other countries mention sending us relief aid as if we are a poor country.",
    "Meanwhile, Russia is on the rise.",
    "They've taken over as the new super power country.",
    "They've really embraced this role as they now swoop in to rescue other countries.",
    "It's an entirely different world.",
    "The new UN wants to establish an armed force that they want the US to be part of.",
    "However, they consider our armed forces to obviously now be subpar.",
    "They don't have the advanced technologies that other countries now have since they have shared technology for all of these years.",
    "We are given a role on par with something Canada would have had in the old days.",
    "We learn that Russia has developed a rail gun technology.",
    "This is something brand new that no one could have imagined previously.",
    "They offer to donate one to us as they think even third world countries deserve a little technology.",
    "We decline as the offer is quite offensive.",
    "We do however, accept an offer to share their Fighter Jets.",
    "They are highly advanced and the ones we have now are utterly useless in the face of such technology.",
    "In order to get the technology from Russia, we agree to a joint military exercise.",
    "It goes quite well though something seems off.",
    "After the exercise they send us on our way with the new jets.",
    "Once they arrive home they are stationed across the country so they are evenly spaced out.",
    "No one suspects anything until it is too late.",
    "A mechanic is looking over one of the jets when he notices something that looks like a bomb.",
    "All at the same time the jets explode throughout the US, wiping out the country.",
    "The UN then meets and says that their plan worked.",
    "They considered the US a rogue country and wanted it off of the map.",
    "Now things are back the way they were supposed to be, with no surprises.",
    "Russia was especially happy with that decision and happy to stay the new super power.",
