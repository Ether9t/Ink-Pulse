They need to refuel, and the easiest way is to kidnap the most famous person nearby.  Fame gives humans an energy that only the aliens can see, and the aliens have the technology to siphon the fame energy to power their ship. \n\nThey kidnap Matt Damon, and bring him back to their ship. The spaceship is a 10-meter sphere, with no openings. The alien is about the size of a human infant, with four fingers. Its head has a large, single eye in the center, and two small ears on either side. It has no nose or mouth.\nThe aliens move by teleporting.  Any place they have been, or any place they will go in the future, they can teleport to.\n\nBut what they don't know, is that Ben Affleck is rallying the humans. Matt Damon has survived both the alien abduction, and being teleported through the ship. He has found a way to communicate with Ben Affleck, and they have hatched a plan to save Matt Damon.\n\nBen Affleck is an expert at teleporting.
