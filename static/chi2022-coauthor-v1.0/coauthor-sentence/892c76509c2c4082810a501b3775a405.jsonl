You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen. \n\nYou are a God-like figure who has the power to grant miracles to those you deem worthy. A person can only receive one miracle in their lifetime, so you must choose carefully who will have the ultimate reward. There is not only pressure on the person receiving the miracle, but there is also pressure on you. \n\nGiving miracles is a huge responsibility. What happens if you give a miracle to someone who does not deserve it? Or what happens if you give the wrong miracle to the right person? These pressures can be a lot for one person to handle. But you have been chosen to give these miracles to people. You are helping them experience a reincarnation of their own. \n\nThrough your decisions, you will be shaping their lives and the lives of everyone they come in contact with. They will be grateful for the miracle and will give it back to you by continuing to spread the gift in their own lives. Over time, you will see the effect of these miracles. Some of the effects will be good. Some of the effects will be bad.\n\nAlthough you are giving miracles away, you are giving them to humans. Humans are not perfect beings. They have flaws. They can be selfish. They can be very self-serving. They can be very greedy. But they also can be helpful. They can be kind. They can be loving.\n\nHuman beings die in terms of the physical world. Our spirit doesn't die. Whether it be reincarnation, heaven or something else, our spirit ascends. We do not die with the physical body. Were you to get an opportunity at reincarnation what would you choose? You would want to live a life where you could really make a difference, wouldn't you? I know I would. And that's what I'm trying to do in this physical world in my current form. Leave this place with a positive legacy behind before I enter the spiritual world. \n\nYou have a chance to make a difference in the life of someone else.",
