It will take her many years to realize just how special she is. \n\nAs the film continues, I start to notice that the little girl is very different from the other children. She is constantly looking up at the stars. She is very curious about the world around her.  She questions everything. She is always asking questions. Some people don't like that. They think she is strange or rude. They tell her to stop asking questions. She doesn't care what they think. She just keeps asking questions. Every time she asks a question in the film that annoys someone, an audience member lets out a laugh. I laugh along with them. I can't help it. I am so happy that I am not like the other kids. \n\nThe lights come on. It's time for intermission. I walk out of the theater and go to the concession stand. Everyone is being served popcorn. I ask for some popcorn as well. Another audience member asks me how I'm enjoying the film so far. \"It's a great story so far! I can't wait to see how it ends.\" \n\nThe lights dim again and the film resumes. The little girl is now a teenager. Then she is a young adult. By the time I'd finished half of my popcorn, she was an elderly woman in her 70s. She is still curious and still asking questions. One day, she thinks of the most brilliant question. ",
