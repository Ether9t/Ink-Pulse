    "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out.",
    "She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.",
    "One day, she’s walking down the street and sees a man she’s never seen before.",
    "She tries to get a good look at him without staring.",
    "She’s not sure why she’s so interested, but she feels like she’s seen him before.",
    "She’s never been to this part of town before, but she feels like she’s been here before.",
    "She stops walking and takes her phone from her bag.",
    "She pretends to send a text while she waits to get a better look at the man.",
    "He starts walking in her direction.",
    "She looks up and sees him looking at her.",
    "Her heart skips a beat.",
    "She looks down at her phone and pretends to send another text.",
    "She looks up again, and he’s gone.",
    "She looks around for a moment, confused.",
    "She shrugs and begins to turn around, and finds him standing right there.",
    "She gasps and drops her phone.",
    "“I’m sorry,” he says, bending down to pick it up.",
    "She is blushing, and reaches to help him.",
    "Their hands touch as they both reach for the phone.",
    "She feels a jolt of electricity.",
    "\"Ow!\" she says, pulling her hand back.",
    "He laughed and his eyes sparkled.",
    "She felt like she was going to melt.",
    "It felt like there literally was magic in the air.",
    "She smiled at him, and he smiled back.",
    "\"Have we met before?\" she asked.",
    "\"You just look so familiar.\" He smiled again, and she felt her knees go weak.",
    "\"No, we haven't met before.",
    "But if I look familiar, it's because you dreamed of me.\" \n\nShe froze.",
    "\"What?\" she asked.",
    "She felt embarrassed.",
    "\"No, I haven't, I mean-\" He laughed again.",
    "Those eyes!",
    "\"It's okay, I'll explain.\" He said patiently.",
    "\"Sometimes, people dream of their perfect match.",
    "And sometimes, those dreams come true.\" She looked at him, confused.",
    "\"What are you saying?\"\n\n\"I'm saying your wish has been granted.",
    "I'm your perfect match.\" She looked at him, her heart pounding.",
    "\"That's all there is too it?\" She asked.",
    "\"No, don't make it sound so simple.",
    "You had a good heart all your life.",
    "You earned me.",
    "Now, how about a hug?\"\n"
