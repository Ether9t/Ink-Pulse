    "Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts.",
    "50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation.",
    "During this time, the Soviet Union conquered the world, enslaving most of humanity and forcing them to work in slave camps.",
    "Only a few cities remain free, and the United States sets out to liberate these slaves.",
    "The single-player campaign is centered around this objective, and the player will have to fight his way through numerous levels (most of which are on-rails) while playing as the protagonists of various missions.Out of Exile makes use of the standard FPS control scheme, namely the WASD keys for movement and mouse aiming; however, players can choose between a first-person view and a third-person view, although the third-person one is only available while using some weapons.",
    "The game also makes use of an auto-aim function and a cover system, which is activated by pressing the Tab key.",
    "Like Gears of War, the player can also perform rolls by double-tapping either forward or backward direction.",
    "The gameplay can be described as something in the old Zelda theme.",
    "Not as straightforward but there are a lot of side jobs.There are plenty of ammo and health pickups scattered around the levels, but some areas have no ammo at all, usually in order to make players think about how they want to proceed through the level, although it's not always clear how much to conserve and how much to use.",
    "In general, Out of Exile is a well-balanced game, and it's not too difficult to complete even on the hardest difficulty settings.The game is divided into three main campaigns, each one having its own set of levels.",
    "Although most of the levels are on-rails and do not allow free roaming around, there are some notable exceptions, one being a mission in which the player controls a tank and the other being a mission which takes place in an abandoned mine.",
    "The game is not too hard nor too easy , but most of the players playing it will find great value in their money as it's something really different than everything else on the market.",
    "The game does not break any records, but it's one of the most unique games we've played lately.",
    "If you are looking for some kind of FPS experience with a twist, this game is definitely worth checking out.",
    "Our Rating: 83/100\n"
