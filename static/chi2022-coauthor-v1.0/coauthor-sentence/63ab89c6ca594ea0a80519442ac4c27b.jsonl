    "When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered.",
    "Now, it's too late.",
    "It is rumored that a new drug has been created.",
    "But the government isn't giving it away for free.",
    "It is too expensive for most citizens so people are going great lengths to obtain it illegally.",
    "To get the drug, you and your friends decide to find a way into the headquarters of the government facility where it is supposedly being held.",

    "They began their journey and successfully make it into the facility.",
    "They follow the map to the vault where the drugs are being stored.",
    "But it turns out there is an alarm.",
    "They hadn't planned for this.",
    "They had to either turn around and leave now, or find a way to bypass the alarm.",
    "They chose to continue and discover an elevator that leads to a secret floor deep within the building.",
    "The elevator descended to the floor below, and then kept going and going.",
    "It was not to the lower floor, but to another section of the facility.",
    "It went down so far they couldn't fathom how far underground they had gone.",

    "\"We shouldn't be down here.",
    "We should just find the product and go.",
    "We shouldn't mess with this stuff.\" your best friend said.",
    "Suddenly, the elevator doors closed and the elevator lifted up away, leaving them in the deep basement.",
    "They were stuck.",

    "A few moments later, the doors opened and a mysterious figure walked in.",
    "He was the leader of the facility.",
    "\"I understand you want access to our product.",
    "I have a better offer.\" he said.",
    "\"I will give you access, but you must agree to my terms.\" They agreed.",
    "\"You will bring me an item every week for the rest of your lives, and I will give you your drug.",
    "If you do not, I will permanently seal off access to this facility.\" They agreed.",
    "They ended up surviving the next wave of mass deaths and were pioneers for the new world.",
