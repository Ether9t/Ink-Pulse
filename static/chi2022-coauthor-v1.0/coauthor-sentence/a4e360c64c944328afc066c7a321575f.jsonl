He goes on to explain that the movie is NOT your destiny.  It is what is likely to happen and watching it gives you the chance to modify it.  \"After the movie is over, you'll have two hours to edit it.  They were supposed to tell you that before the movie started, but the folks running the Reincarnation Division have gotten lazy over the last few years.  After the movie is over, we'll all chat about it for an hour, give you advice, and then you have that time to rewrite some parts.  You can't rewrite the whole thing, you have to pick the things that you most want to change.\"\n\nYou ask if you will remember this whole thing when you are reborn.\n\n",
