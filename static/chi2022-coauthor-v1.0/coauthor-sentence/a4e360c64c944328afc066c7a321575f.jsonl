    "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you.",
    "You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.",
    "The film you are watching is your life, and you are watching it from the moment you are born until the moment you die.",
    "Your mind is a clean slate as you watch the movie.",
    "Everything you see is unknown.",
    "But you also start to realize that you don't remember any of your other lives.",
    "So why are you seeing this?",
    "This is your next life and if it's a movie, it must mean that you can't do anything about it.",
    "A few hours in, there is an intermission.",
    "You walk to the concessions stand, and get in line.",
    "You see a lot of people in the line who look like you, and you are all talking about your lives.",
    "In fact, you realize that everyone looks like you, and you are surprised that you look so similar in every life.",
    "You also notice that you are the only one who doesn't remember their previous lives.",
    "You start chatting with an elderly you that is standing in line behind you.",
    "\"Have you been through this before?\" you ask him.",
    "\"Yes, I have,\" he replies.",
    "\"How many times?\" you ask.",
    "\"This is the 14th for me,\" he says.",
    "\"I'm guessing this is your first, because you seem kind of lost.\"\n\nYou tell him it is, and that while you can buy into the concept that you're about to be reincarnated, you're unclear as to why you are seeing a movie of what is your destiny.",
    "\"No, you have it wrong!\" he says.",
    "He goes on to explain that the movie is NOT your destiny.",
    "It is what is likely to happen and watching it gives you the chance to modify it.",
    "\"After the movie is over, you'll have two hours to edit it.",
    "They were supposed to tell you that before the movie started, but the folks running the Reincarnation Division have gotten lazy over the last few years.",
    "After the movie is over, we'll all chat about it for an hour, give you advice, and then you have that time to rewrite some parts.",
    "You can't rewrite the whole thing, you have to pick the things that you most want to change.\"\n\nYou ask if you will remember this whole thing when you are reborn.",
    "\"No, you won't,\" he says.",
    "\"But you will remember once this next life is over, like I do, and you'll do this again when you die but you'll remember everything then, and you'll be able to give the next you advice.",
    "You notice the lights are blinking, signaling the movie is about to begin again.",
    "You thank the man and walk back to you seat with your popcorn and soda.",
    "As the movie starts again, you watch with new purpose, determined to find the things you want to change to make your next life your best one yet.",
