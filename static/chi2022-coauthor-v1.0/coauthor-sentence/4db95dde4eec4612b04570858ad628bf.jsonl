    "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out.",
    "She's unaware that she's actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who's fallen for her, and is certain he's going to get it right this time.",
    "She was starting to grow tired of always going on first dates, but she actually kind of liked the spontaneity of it.",
    "She was meeting someone new each night, so she could present herself in a different way, depending on her mood.",
    "It didn't matter whether it was a blind date or not, though, because they all ended up being the same.",
    "No matter what she said, or how she introduced herself, all of her suitors seemed to ask the same sets of questions.",
    "She felt like she was always giving the same answers too.",
    "No matter how much she tried to pretend to be someone else, she felt compelled to tell the truth.",
    "She got the sinking feeling that someone might remember if she gave a false answer.",
    "\"Was it possible that she had been dating the same guy over and over again?\" she thought to herself.",
    "\"No, that's preposterous\" she quickly responded to the voice in her head.",
    "They must be communicating, somehow.",
    "Maybe all the single guys in this city have started their own social network.",
    "Everyone who gets turned down by a woman gives advice to the others, and they try to learn from each other's mistakes.",
    "\"Or maybe I'm just unattainable\" she thought.",
    "Even so, she decided to get ready for another date.",
    "It might not lead anywhere, but at least she was enjoying herself, and getting free dinner to boot.",
    "That night, she was meeting a guy who had just moved to the city, and he didn't know anybody.",
    "But when he showed up at her house, he looked exactly like someone she had already dated.",
    "\"What did you say your name was?\" she asked him\n\n\"Jack Johnson\" he replied\n\n\"Do you have a twin brother, named John Jackson?\"\n\nHe got nervous and sweaty at that point.",
    "\"No, I'm serious.\"  I met him just last week, \"See, we took pictures together!\" and she showed him some smiling photos of herself with her one-time date who looked exactly like this new stranger.",
    "\"Oh no\" he moaned.",
    "\"I can't do it anymore!\"\n\nHe didn't explain himself, but she understood.",
    "\"That's okay,\" she said, \"I had fun with you the last time you looked like this.",
    "Why don't we try again.",
    "Can I call you John?\"\n\nRelieved, he let out a sigh, \"Well, my real name is 325b055dc5354c97bcec21e33d77a96b.",
    "But John works, too.",
    "Now, this time, why don't you tell me all about yourself?\"\n\n\nTHE END\n"
