    "Humans once wielded formidable magical power.",
    "But with over 7 billion of us on the planet now, Mana has spread far too thinly to have any effect.",
    "When hostile aliens reduce humanity to a mere fraction, the survivors discover an old power has begun to reawaken once again.",
    "They begin to see it show up in different ways.",
    "Each person's unique talents help them to tap into specific powers.",
    "It takes a while to master them, but one group spends all of their free time doing just that.",
    "After all, someone has to stop the aliens before there are no humans left!",
    "This is the story of the first group of humans to master their new powers.",
    "As a group they are able to do things like levitate objects, move things with their mind, start fire and even freeze objects.",
    "One day they witness an entire nearby city destroyed and decide there is no time to waste.",
    "It is time to confront the aliens with their new powers.",
    "The aliens are giant creatures.",
    "There are not many of them, but the ones that exist are the size of mountains.",
    "Because of that they can easily destroy anything in their path.",
    "The group takes on their first alien.",
    "Due to its size and their inexperience in battle it takes all day for them to finally defeat it.",
    "They are ecstatic though in their victory and have learned some tricks to defeating them.",
    "They then move around, taking them out as they travel.",
    "It is exhausting and slowly their numbers continue to shrink.",
    "The one upside to that though is that the Mana increases for those who are alive.",
    "They are able to use their powers more effectively and with greater ease.",
    "This cycle continues, where each fallen soldier's Mana keeps making the survivors stronger.",
    "After months of this, there is just one survivor left.",
    "He is unstoppable at this point.",
    "He takes out the remainder of the aliens and in the end is left alone with his victory.",
    "He is the last of his kind, but he is able to use his powers to create a new race of humans.",
    "As more are born, he loses his power.",
    "The cycle continues where humans lose their powers and in the end it all happens again, with aliens attacking once our Mana is stretched too thin.",
