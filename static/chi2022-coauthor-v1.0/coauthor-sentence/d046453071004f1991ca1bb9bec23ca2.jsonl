This means that the movie could in some ways be a bit distorted. You might feel betrayed in the way that some people view you and your life story, if others' perceptions don't align with your own. \n\nHowever, even if the movie is not an accurate portrayal of your life, it is still a good idea to watch it. This is because this exercise can be a hugely transformative experience. It is also a humbling one, as it's so rare to get an objective third party view of yourself. \n\nThe movie that plays at your life's end is also a good opportunity to reflect on your life.",
