    "They can change the plot of their life, and even alter their own fate.",
    "This means that in the movie, you might be able to resolve the issues that you had with the girl you got into a huge argument with and had a falling out with, or that guy you broke up with on bad terms, or that parent you had a bad relationship with that couldn't be fixed.",

    "Of course the movie that will play at your life's end might be able to give you some sense of closure but it cannot necessarily be your fallback crutch.",

    "This is because this exercise can be a hugely transformative experience.",
    "It is also a humbling one, as it's so rare to get an objective third party view of yourself.",
    "The movie that plays at your life's end is also a good opportunity to reflect on your life.",
    "But the important thing to walk away with from this contemplation and reflection is that no one is perfect.",
    "No one who watches the movie of their life will ever feel that the events in their life unfolded absolutely perfectly.",
