    "All of the \"#1 Dad\" mugs in the world change to show the actual ranking of Dads suddenly.",
    "The dad's act like they do not care, but it is true, that nothing is sacred anymore.",
    "Dad, the ultimate judge and jury, is now being judged.",
    "Based on dad's values?",
    "Of course not!",
    "Why would anyone put their own needs and desires aside to stroke dad's ego?",
    "It is high time dad's take a look at who their children are, and what they need, rather than being a fake persona based on what guys think.",
    "Dad's have no idea how to handle this growing trend of judgement.",
    "Dad's used to be in charge.",
    "That is changing fast.",
    "Dad's could now be the brunt of the joke but kids and moms are more sensitive than that.",
    "Just for once, macho dad needs to ask himself and other trusted family member \"How am I doing?\" Do I know my kids?",
    "Do I need some guidance in challenging situations?",
    "Do I even know that challenges exist?",
    "In the USA, there are around 30 million stay-at-home dads and their ego's do not know how to handle it.",
    "The mugs have stopped producing the rankings.",
    "Dad's are relieved.",
    "They are even ready to listen.",
    "It is going to take time and effort in the face of changes and resistance, but it takes a while to undo the wired damages.",
    "Dad's have a good side too and can still be manly if that is their thing.",
    "They are not all bad in all the ways.",
    "The rankings on the mugs was a great wake up call.",
    "Now let the work begin.",
