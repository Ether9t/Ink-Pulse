You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.\n\nThere have actually been a few movies I have seen recently that used this exact concept. They were very interesting and really made you think about what happens at the \"end\". It would definitely be more interesting than a typical funeral where people just talk and cry. Seeing yourself interjected into a movie is something I think would be interesting. This is a very intriguing movie idea and I think it would be an awesome concept for a movie. I have always been fascinated with the idea of reincarnation as it essentially means someone can live on forever. I also think that could be a very interesting premise to have as a movie. Watching what is essentially the same person take on different bodies and lives would be intriguing to see. I believe most people would find this concept interesting and would want to know more about it. It would also be pretty cool to watch the main character of a movie reincarnate as you would essentially get to see all of their lives in one movie. \n\nReincarnation overall is a very conceptual idea that has roots in ancient culture. I believe this movie would be a great way to get people thinking about the idea of reincarnation. Most ancient cultures had at least some beliefs that a person would come back after death. This movie would be a great way to show how the idea of reincarnation has impacted the culture in general. In a way, it would help people wrap their heads around the concept and possibly learn how it has been viewed throughout history. I think that this movie would be very popular and would be an interesting concept to watch. The movie could begin with a man waking up and throughout the movie, it shows flashbacks of the man's past transgressions and what led up to the reincarnation event. This would allow the viewer to become more invested in the man and develop an interest in what he did so wrong that caused a reincarnation event.\n\nIn closing I do believe this is a fascinating idea for a movie and actually has some roots in our history overall. The movie could even go into how different cultures view reincarnation and show examples. This would be a great way to get people thinking about this fascinating topic.",
