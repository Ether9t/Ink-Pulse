    "Your entire life, you've been told you're deathly allergic to bees.",
    "You've always had people protecting you from them, be it your mother or a hired hand.",
    "Today, one slips through and lands on your shoulder.",
    "You hear a tiny voice say \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\"\n\n\"My orders are for you to not give my identity away.",
    "I said please don't speak with me in public like this.\" \n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\" said the bee.",
    "\"Meet me in my room in ten minutes.\" you said.",
    "You arrive at the room, and the bee is waiting for you.",
    "Humans always told you that you were allergic to bees.",
    "How could you be allergic to your own kind though.",
    "The humans didn't know that you were acting as a spy bee for your bee kingdom because only you would be happy to learn the truth of what you needed to discover about humans.",
    "\"So, what is it that you need me to do?\" asked the bee.",
    "\"I need you to keep a watch for the guards in their rooms and listen for anything they might have to say.",
    "We really need to know if humans plan to attack our hive or not.",
    "Report to me tonight right here.",
    "I'll go talk to the controller of pests.\" you said.",
    "As you made your way down the hall of the castle, you spotted the pest control person.",
    "You stopped him and asked when he planned to get rid of the bee hive outside the castle gates.",
    "He looks at you with great confusion and says \"I don't know what you're talking about.",
    "We don't plan on getting rid of it, bees are needed to keep our flowers blooming so we want to keep it there.\" and he walks away.",
    "As you get back to your room, the bee is waiting and reports of no such plans.",
    "You tell him, all bees outside the gates are safe.",
    "You turn back into a bee, and fly home.",
