    "When you die, you appear in a cinema with a number of other people who look like you.",
    "You find out that they are your previous reincarnations, and soon you all begin watching your next life on the big screen.",
    "Sitting there, looking around, a lot of things start to make sense.",
    "I can see clearly where some of my centermost characteristics were born.",
    "Suddenly, it seems like an obvious conclusion that I never could quite see before.",
    "I've lived before, and it's awe inspiring to consider what that means as the idea unfolds in my mind.",
    "What does it mean to live before?",
    "It's like time and space don't exist, at all.",
    "Like this is all just some sort of weird, temporal dream state.",
    "Am I writing this script, or is the script writing me?",
    "I'm literally thinking these thoughts, and yet there is no time or space to accommodate this reality.",
    "How can the past me, my current self and some future version of me appearing on the screen, all exist?",
    "All at once?",
    "All here, in this place?",
    "Did I invent this scenario?",
    "Do I even exist?",
    "I'm so confused by what is unfolding within me.",
    "I think I'll stay here a bit longer and let it sink in.",
    "I think I'll just try to accept what I'm seeing, and pass no judgement.",
    "Maybe, with that attitude, some of my questions will resolve themselves.",
    "Or, if not, I'll accept that those questions may never be answered.",
    "All I know for sure is, this is a special place.",
    "I think that this might be the only place.",
    "I may only exist in this space, or not at all.",
    "Either way, I am dead but I am here.",
    "My life is finished, but I am here.",
