        "text": "Following World War III, all the nations of the world agreed to 50 years of strict isolation from one another in order to prevent additional conflicts. 50 years later, the United States comes out of exile, only to learn that no one else went into isolation. \n\nIt seemed foolish of the U.S to not verify that the other countries were isolating, but the passing through of borders was strictly prohibited. The U.S. government decided to send a special task force to find out what happened to the other countries. The task force is sent through the border and discovers that the other countries have been destroyed by a nuclear war. The task force is then ambushed by a group of survivors, who are revealed to be the descendants of the people who survived the nuclear war. \n\nThe survivors are led by a man named Kincaid, who is the leader of a religious cult that worships the nuclear war. Kincaid claims that the nuclear war was sent by God to cleanse the world of sin. The survivors, who have been living in the ruins of the other countries, have created a new society based on their own interpretation of the Bible. \n\nThe task force is taken to a city called New Jerusalem, where they are put on trial for the sins of their ancestors. The task force is sentenced to death, but they are rescued by a man named Joshua, who is the leader of a group of rebels who oppose Kincaid. Joshua claims that Kincaid is a false prophet, and that the nuclear war was not sent by God. \n\nJoshua takes the task force to the ruins of Washington D.C., where he shows them a computer that was created by the government before. The computer contains a recording of the last president of the United States, who tells the task force that the nuclear war was not sent by God, but by a group of scientists who wanted to destroy the world. The president tells the task force that the survivors are not the descendants of the people who survived the nuclear war, but are actually the descendants of the scientists. \n\nWith this newfound knowledge, the survivors must decide how to use this information, to save the world, and themselves.
