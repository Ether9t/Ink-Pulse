    "A woman has been dating guy after guy, but it never seems to work out.",
    "She’s unaware that she’s actually been dating the same guy over and over; a shapeshifter who’s fallen for her, and is certain he’s going to get it right this time.",
    "One day, she meets a man who seems different from the rest.",
    "There were none of the early red flags that had plagued each of her other failed relationships.",
    "It was a bittersweet feeling though, because despite the fact that the others didn't work out, there had been something about the guys that she just felt an intense connection to.",
    "She was a little sad that she would never see them again, but she was also excited about the prospect of a new relationship.",
    "There was that feeling upon first meeting him not so much that she knew him before, but that she was supposed to know him.",
    "It was still exciting in the way that new relationships are, but without the adrenaline rush of falling into the unknown.",
    "They dated for a while, and she began to feel like she was falling in love.",
    "Until one night over a take out dinner and a movie he asked her about her past relationships.",
    "She could lie and act like they had all been horrible, but it had always been her policy to be honest and mature.",
    "She loathed the way that some would throw others under the bus just to make themselves look better in the relationship.",
    "She told him about the guys she had dated, and how she had felt an intense connection to them.",
    "She was worried that she might be going overboard by telling him about the good points of each.",
    "But she couldn't help the warmth that crept into her voice when she recounted her time with them.",
    "She looked down at her wineglass while she told him about each one.",
    "She was afraid to see his expression and was sure he did not have a pleasant one.",
    "But she was helpless to stop.",
    "It was as if she was compelled to keep telling him about the others and unable to tell him anything but the truth.",
    "When she was finished, she looked up at him.",
    "For a moment she was stunned.",
    "He was not sitting there with a look of disgust on his face.",
    "Instead he was gently smiling and looking at her like she was the most precious being on earth.",
    "He gently stroked the side of her face and told her how special she was.",
    "After a tender kiss he leaned back and looked at her intently.",
    "Then he told her it was that special quality that made him unable to give up on her.",
    "At first she was confused.",
    "But then he explained to her that all of the men had been him.",
    "Every good part of the previous men were still there.",
    "But with each time he failed with her, he learned what he had done wrong and kept trying.",
    "And now finally he was literally her perfect man, because he had spent years learning from his failure to be just that.",
    "It was overwhelming for her and she knew that it would take awhile to sink in.",
    "But for now, she was content to relax herself in his arms, marveling over how one person could have possibly loved her that much.",
    "And in the circle of his arms she knew without a doubt that she had found the one.",
