When you're 85, the side effects are finally discovered. \n\nThere is this odor that certain people exude. It's both familiar as well as off-putting. You notice the smell more often in large crowds and it's becoming troubling enough that you've begun to stay home. You don't mind much, you've lived a long life.\n\nIt's one thing to see your former college friends brag about their lives on social media, never having changed their looks. It's another to be on the subway and see someone who looks like your former best friend, and then smell the tell-tale scent of decay. You hide your face as others in the subway hear your gasp. You realize that you are the only person in that packed subway who has aged. \n\nThe smell intensifies, making you gag. You hide your face, tuck it into your scarf, breathing in the scent of your lotion. You convince yourself that you are smelling your own breath, but the smell is still there. You exit the car at the next stop, despite it being 3 exits from home. \n\nThe smell lingers in your nose as you rush home. You enter the house and lock the door, rushing towards your master bathroom only to be taken aback when you step foot in your bedroom. A man is standing there, looking at you. The smell is here. \n\nYou drop to your knees, a hand on your mouth as you feel yourself retch.\n\n\"Why?",
